Selevä... onkse päälä? pyörii perkele!
We are ready
Well I had a lots of money
But now I dont have it at all
I have spent all my money to the whiskey and beer
And thats why im playing here
Well I had a lots of money
But now I dont have it at all
I have spent all my money to the whiskey and beer
And thats why im playing here
(chorus)
So
I drink
I drink
I drink
I drink
And i dont wanna even think
I drink
I drink
I drink drink my wine
So
I drink
I drink
I drink
I drink
And i dont wanna even think
I drink
I drink
I drink all the time
Well I had a lots of money
But now I have it at all
I have spent all my money
To the whiskey and beer and thats why im playing in here
(chorus)
