A snake has bitten me, it has made me weak
God's betrayed me, playing hide and seek
So much joy keeps slipping through my fingers
So much pain I've chosen on my way
Seven serpents lying on my bed of fire
Oh how real the dream appears
How strong the dark desire
Hold me like our love was in its sweet beginning
Whisper all those lies you know I long to hear
But you say that
Poison is drowning my poor heart
Poison is killing out our spark
Poison has made its ways in me
Poison let me go peacefully
Standing on the porch with a burning torch
Looking at thе dark skies of Eden
Be my еxorcist, drive the bad away
The lonely violinist plays and turns the sheets of days
So much joy you've laid upon my sorrow
So much shame you've taken of my name
You say that
Poison is drowning my poor heart
Poison is killing out our spark
Poison has made its ways in me
Poison let me go peacefully
Standing on the porch with a burning torch
Looking at the dark skies of Eden
Looking at the dark skies, looking at the dark skies of Eden
Looking at the dark skies, looking at the dark skies of Eden
Poison is drowning my poor heart
Poison is killing out our spark
Poison has made its ways in me
Poison you and I eternally
Standing on the porch with a flaming torch
Looking at the dark skies of Eden
