I've been killed, I really have
Softly shot by your magic hand
And the shimmering lights, glorious nights in the garden
I've been blind, yes I have
But something's changed and I understand
What gentelness means in the garden
No, it's not a secret that my heart had been buried, unfound
To the silence, to the dust
Into the sad and sorry ground
The garden of love, the garden of love gave me sorrow
The sinners and the saints
All they ever gave me were heartbrakes, babe
The Garden of Love, the Garden of Love left me hollow
The beggars and the fakes
All they ever gave me were heartaches, babe
And now you're here to save me
Can I be saved?
I've been sad and so confused
That I've started wars just to feel abused
Scared of happiness, proud like a soldier
Now I'm lost without my shield
I've left all my arms on the battlefield
Through these rusty rhymes I plead, come to me
No, it's not a secret that my heart had me buried, unfound
To the silence, to the dust, into the sad and sorry ground
The Garden of Love, the Garden of Love gave me sorrow
The sinners and the saints
All they ever gave me were heartbrakes, babe
The Garden of Love, the Garden of Love left me hollow
The beggars and the fakes
All they ever gave me were heartaches, maybe now you're here to save me
Fruits of the tree in the midst of the garden
You shall not take it and you shall not pick it
God only knows that the day you will take it
Your eyes will be opened, your hearts will be poisoned
Take me, guide me, let me softly lie in your garden
Hold me, free me, never let me leave you
