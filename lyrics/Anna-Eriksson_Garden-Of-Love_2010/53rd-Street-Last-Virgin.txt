She's watching the silent days go by
Praying for man and his never ending crime
Dreaming of the winds in the willows
City night's knocking on her windows
She stays in, stays out of sin
She's just that way
Praying for the children in need
Acheing in her wounds makes her quiver, makes her bleed
She doesn't want a life of constant yerning
City lights flashing and wings are burning
Too damn wise to compromise
She's just that way
53rd street Last Virgin lives for the day she'll see the light
Lonely Last Virgin knows what it takes to do things right
In her heart, in her head, when she's laying on her bed
Lonely Last Virgin knows what it takes to do things right
Voices haunting her sometimes
Visions of the end painting shadows in her eyes
She's a silent word in the story
A halo of light on frozen glory
Not too wise for paradise
She's on her way
53rd street Last Virgin lives for the day she'll see the light
Lonely Last Virgin knows what it takes to do things right
In her heart, in her head, when she's crying on her bed
Only Last Virgin knows how it aches to do things right
