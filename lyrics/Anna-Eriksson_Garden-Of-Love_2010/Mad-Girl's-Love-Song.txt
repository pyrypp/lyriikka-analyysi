You can call me Sylvia
I've seen you walk on by
With your naughty smile
You shoot me high
To the night light, so bright
You can call me Sylvia
You can call me what you like
In my twisted mind
Our stories rhyme
In the casket, we entwine
I forgive my daddy
When I'm under your haunting charms
I know that death becomes me
Loves a bed full of broken arms
I may be mad, I may be broken
But still
I may be sad, carelessly chosen
But still
This is still a love song
This is still a love song
A mad girl's love song
You can call me Sylvia
And I sleep on broken glass
The dark despair
In the morning air
I wake up and someday miss
You can call me Sylvia
And I think our God plays dead
You can make me crawl
And induce my fall
I still pray for you instead
Please don't bring me flowers
Flash white tulips above my grave
In these naked hours
Life can solemnly be my slave
I may be mad, I may be broken
But still
I may be sad, carelessly chosen
But still
This is still a love song
This is still a love song
A mad girl's love song
No one can remember me like you do
Then forget me quite like you do
When you voice so softly soothes me
Then it crudely breaks me
Makes me feel no pain
No pain
I may be mad, I may be broken
But still
I may be sad, carelessly chosen
But still
This is still a love song
This is still a love song
A mad girl's love song
