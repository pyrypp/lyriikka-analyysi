You pray for an answer way too late
You're finally reached asking age
You feel you life's hands stand
And wonder where your hair fell
What you ask from the devil, you are already
Dionysus' reincarnation
Re-birthed beast of prey
That cursing fucks and rushes into the pit

Shredder
Shredder
Shredder

Where'd you drop your golden ticket
On fours you search it, fuck it's taken
You wish in your life new ordering
Although you just need physical commanding
Forget segregation, racism
Inequality, Satan, sadism
Put the shrеdder on already
Run boy run

From your life's cеnter to the edge
Over the edge
Onto the steel tooth
From center to the edge
Over the edge
Onto the steel tooth
It is run or die
Run or die
Run or die
Run or die
Run or die
