I try to recall the faces deep in my heart
I feel like a million ages tear us all apart
Though some are so far from me, forgotten almost
You are the one I remember most
We all have a star above us shining so bright
My memories are like the stardust lightening my night
Though you are so far away, but first and for most
You are the one I remember most
If I'd to choose one day and throw the rest away
I would pick up the day you for the first time smile at me
If there's a place on earth I'd rather not return
The place I lost you is the saddest place I've been
I try to recall the faces deep in my heart
I feel like a million ages tear us all apart
And some are so far from me, forgotten almost
You are the one I remember most
If I could turn back time and make it all alright
I would go to the day you sweetly came in to my life
If I'd to change one thing don't know where to begin
Cause it's some change up all I feel for you inside
We all have a star above us shining so bright
My memories are like the stardust lightening my night
Though you are so far away, but first and for most
You are the one I remember most
Though you are so far away, first and for most
You are the one I remember most
