Here I am with open arms
Waiting for my boy to come to me
And when my baby's here with all his charms
I whisper to his ear in secrecy
Baby

Funny how all dreams come true
Like a fool I'm into you
The day we met I lost my sanity
Funny how I feel for you
Like a fool I'm into you
You washed away my insecurity

Here we lie heart to heart
A perfect night for keeping you so near
And we'll let all the world drift far apart
As I hear you whisper to my ear
Baby

Funny how all dreams come true
Like a fool I'm into you
The day we met I lost my sanity
Funny how I feel for you
Like a fool I'm into you


Dreams come true
Like a fool I'm into you
The day we met I lost my sanity
Funny what our love can do
Like a fool I'm into you boy
Dreams come true
Like a fool I'm into you
The day we met I lost my sanity
Funny how I feel for you
Like a fool I'm into you
You washed away my insecurity
