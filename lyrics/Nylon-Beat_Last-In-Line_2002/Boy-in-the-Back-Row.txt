We used to share the same classroom for years
Beginning from the second grade
All the others have their careers, I'm still alone
But I got all your photos at my home
Hey you the boy in the back row
Do you remember me?
When for the first time I took your hand in mine
You used to call me a black crow
I found it flattery
I still recall our final kiss goodbye
I heard you married someone from my school
But now I can't think of her name
I must have been a fool when I let you go
Now there's only those photos at my home
Hey you the boy in the back row
Do you remember me?
When for the first time I took your hand in mine
You used to call me a black crow
I found it flattery
I still recall our final kiss goodbye
Hey you the boy in the back row
Do you remember me?
When for the first time I took your hand in mine
