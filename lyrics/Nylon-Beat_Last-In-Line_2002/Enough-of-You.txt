If I should see you only every now and then
That wouldn't be too much to handle
But you chose the wrong play
And everyday I find you at my door again
With wine and roses and a candle
That isn't okay
I got to say, it's true had enough of you
Now and forever
I got to make my move
So you're creeping on my window, I say you no, no
And all you say or do is enough of you
Cause no means no never
I need a quick rescue
So you're sneaking in my garden, my underwear was stolen
And you keep following me the other side of street
I see your shadow every day
It isn't the right way
I understand how much affection we are mean
But you, you got curious in the wrong way
And that isn't okay
I got to say, it's true had enough of you
Now and forever
I got to make my move
So you're creeping on my window, I say you no, no
And all you say or do is enough of you
Cause no means no never
I need a quick rescue
So you're sneaking in my garden, my underwear was stolen
Hey, I got to say, it's true had enough of you
Now and forever
I got to make my move
So you're creeping on my window, I say you no, no
And all you say or do is enough of you
Cause no means no never
I need a quick rescue
So you're sneaking in my garden, my underwear was stolen
