Every night and every day
I think of you and want to say
You're deadly company
And every where I go or stay
This feeling will find its way
Your love is killing me
Love's poison, poison
Cause anything else doesn't matter to me
Before long it's all gone
My bittersweet love's running free
Love is poison, poison
Addicted to something I just can't leave
I'm on this poison
It's everything I ever need
I can't think of being without
No one crumbling in announce
There's no cure for me
It's the way you touched my heart
Stay 'till death drew us apart
Hear my remedy
Love's poison, poison
Cause anything else doesn't matter to me
Before long it's all gone
My bittersweet love's running free
Love is poison, poison
Addicted to something I just can't leave
I'm on this poison
It's everything I ever need
