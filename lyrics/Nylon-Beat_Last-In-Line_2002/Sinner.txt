I'm looking for a lazy way
To get trough my working day
Yeah I know it's true
It's a sin for sure
Whenever I cross the street
The trafficlight's never green
Yeah but it's not for you
It's a sin to do
I wan't to give my helping hand
To turn an angel to a man
And find that sinner from your heart
You do not need to understand
Don't have to be a gentle man
Look for that sinner in your heart
Somebody stole my neighbours car
I didn't drive it all that far
Yeah I know it's true
It's a sin for sure
Now you have seen the worst of me
Try to catch that lovely feel
Yeah 'cause it's all for you
We've a sin to do
I wan't to give my helping hand
To turn an angel to a man
And find that sinner from your heart
You do not need to understand
Don't have to be a gentle man
Look for that sinner in your heart
I wan't to give my helping hand
To turn an angel to a man
And find that sinner from your heart
You do not need to understand
Don't have to be a gentle man
