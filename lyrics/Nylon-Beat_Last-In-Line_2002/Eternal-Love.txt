How can we reach eternity
If love is so hard for you and me
Why must we keep on fighting on and on
How will I know if you're my man
When my heart don't always understand
That you keep telling stories of your own
And I know
That we have come to the end
Just let go
I wanna go my way
Eternal love
You couldn't give me eternal love
You didn't bring me eternal love
Maybe it's meant to be
Let me go my own way
Eternal love
Eternal love
Eternal love
All the lonely nights in bed
Makes me count all tears that I have shed
Why are broken hearts so hard to mend
And my heart refuses to believe
That your kisses don't belong to me
'Cause you have found yourself a brand
New friend
And I know
That we have come to the end
Just let go
I wanna go my way
Eternal love
You couldn't give me eternal love
You didn't bring me eternal love
Maybe it's meant to be
Let me go my own way
Eternal love
You couldn't give me eternal love
You didn't bring me eternal love
Maybe it's meant to be Let me go my own way
