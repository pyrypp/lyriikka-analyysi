Hey, what am I going to do
Can't get this by with you
You hide away from me
And I understand
If kiss will make you shy
But please, don't say goodbye
When I try to make you see:
You're the last in line
Anything but fine
Waste of time
But still you're mine
You're far from cool
Nothing better than fool
But I swear it's true
I do love you

Hey, you leave your band in blues
In someone else's shoes
To me it's all okey
And now you're bore
Under a lucky star
And sense in your heart
But hear when I will say:
You're the last in line
Anything but fine
Waste of time
But still you're mine
You're far from cool
Nothing better than fool
But I swear it's true
I do love you
