It must have been July
When I met you
On a gentle August night
You kissed me too
Before the fall I was so sure you're my own
September I was all alone
Like black rain from the clear blue sky falling on me
You left me without saying goodbye alone as can be
Like black rain on a summer night falling on me
You took away my love and light but I still believe
Next March I've got your note
You said: some day
That letter gave me hope
All trough May
And when the summer came I waited in vain
It was a lonely June again
Like black rain from the clear blue sky falling on me
You left me without saying goodbye alone as can be
Like black rain on a summer night falling on me
You took away my love and light but I still believe
Like black rain from the clear blue sky falling on me
You left me without saying goodbye alone as can be
Like black rain on a summer night falling on me
You took away my love and light but I still believe
Like black rain from the clear blue sky falling on me
