It's another summer night
Nothing seems to be so right
'Cause dinner with my boyfriend turned again to be a fight
And like this is not enough
I end up walking in the rain
All wet and lonely thinking only what went wrong this evening
And I must get back to you
There is nothing else to do
But I called to and decide this time I'll make the move
When your life is showing nothing
But some misery and pain
Turn it up or turn it down but try to find this feeling
Sex while a taxi ride
You and I on the hot back seat
What a drive, what a summer night!
Making love on all four wheels
Sex while a taxi ride
Steamy windows roll the street
There's no reason to be shy
Around the block I feel your love on me
Au (I feel your love on me)
I'm not going to change it all
Quit the game and lose the ball
But I'd better take a chance before my sky begins to fall
I just found a great new way
To add some spices to my life
It's a new sensation, taxi station, kisses while we're moving!
Sex while a taxi ride
You and I on the hot back seat
What a drive, what a summer night!
Making love on all four wheels
Sex while a taxi ride
Steamy windows roll the street
There's no reason to be shy
Around the block I feel your love on me
Au (I feel your love, I feel your love on me)
Sex while a taxi ride
Au on the hot back seat
What a drive, what a summernight
Let's make love on all four wheels
Sex while a taxi ride
Taxi ride, taxi rides
There's no reason to be shy
Around the block I feel your love on me
