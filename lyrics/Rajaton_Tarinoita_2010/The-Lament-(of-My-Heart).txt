Something died inside
My crippled soul now cries
The emptiness is wide
Just shadows of my lies
The lament of my heart
Of my heart
The lonely winds are blowing
I shiver in the night
The desperation is growing
There is no place to hide
The lament of my heart
Of my heart
Oh, if my pain was the whitest dove
It would fly to you and rest on your palm
And if it had the voice of love
It would sing to you
The lament of my heart
The lament of my heart
Where's the consolation?
Oh, where is the peace I prayed for?
I weep in desolation
’Till there are tears no more
The lament of my heart
Lament of my heart
Oh, if my pain was the whitest dove
It would fly to you and rest on your palm
And if it had the voice of love
It would sing to you
The lament of my heart
And if my pain was a beautiful rainbow
It would end with you and I would be the start
And if the wind had the voice of love
It would bring to you
The lament of my heart
The lament of my heart
The darkness is too dark
I'm left alone in the cold
I cannot find the spark
I've got no lights to hold
The emptiness is wide
The darkness is too dark
Where’s the well of truth?
The lament of my heart
