I remember shadows on the white tablecloth
While I waited for him... I was far away
Saw her through the window looking far away
While the candlelight danced on the tablecloth
Every sound around me was a lullaby
I could just surrender with a little cry
How I prayed she'd lift her face and catch my eye
Who was she waiting for?
Was it to say goodbye?
Do I disappear so easy?
Do I fade away so neatly?
I remember so completely
Love, have you forgotten me?
Do I disappear so easy?
Do I fade away so sweetly?
I remember so completely
Love, have you forgotten me?
I remember teardrops on the white tablecloth
While I waited to say all I had to say
Saw her through the window but I turned away
While the rain hit my face with teardrops
Every sound around me made me see him there:
There's a ghost before me, then the window's bare
How her eyes were shining in the candlelight
I still see them shine
I see them every night
Do I disappear so easy?
Do I fade away so neatly?
I remember so completely
Love, have you forgotten me?
Do I disappear so easy?
Do I fade away so sweetly?
I remember so completely
Love, have you forgotten me?
Love, have you forgotten me?
Do I disappear so easy?
Do I fade away so neatly?
I remember so completely
Love, have you forgotten me?
Do I disappear so easy?
Do I fade away so sweetly?
I remember so completely
Love, have you forgotten me?
Do I disappear so easy?
Do I fade away so neatly?
I remember so completely
Love, have you forgotten me?
Do I disappear so easy?
Do I fade away so neatly?
I remember so completely
Love, you have forgotten me
