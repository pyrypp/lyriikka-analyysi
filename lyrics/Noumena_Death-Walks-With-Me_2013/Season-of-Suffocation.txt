I burn dead leaves
Red, rustling piles
I taste fear, inhale the fumes
As end is drawing near
Horror in her eyes, lungs paralyzed
Stains of Prussian blue cover the chamber walls

We hover together, we mingle forever
Towards solution
We hover together, one combined with other
Through the darkened flue, reaching the night sky
Offer her a ride, solemn and dignified
Head for the relief, final journey on wooden cart

Autumn drowns my heart, veils the firmament
Brings the end of the future
Season dims the light, leaves the icy glow
To awaken the slumbering
Horror in her eyes, lungs paralyzed
Stains of Prussian blue cover the chamber walls

Feeding consuming flames
We hover together, we mingle forever
Towards solution
Feeding consuming flames
We hover together, one combined with other
Through the darkened flue
Reaching the night sky
