The period of time before the moment we share
Wasted in avoidance of inescapable loss
The barriers of perception cause an obscene conception
A tragedy is born, inside a doleful mind a beast

Nothing feels like before
Years are changing like hours
Passing by like a brief rain shower
In the moment we share
Obedience we swear
Tortured mortals full of spirit and virtue
Seek the premise to achieve another kind of life
For salvation of mankind deliver slaughter of a star
Carnage of a moon, ignition of a cross

Help me to create
Another kind of world
Where everyone I see is free
From the burden of deceased
