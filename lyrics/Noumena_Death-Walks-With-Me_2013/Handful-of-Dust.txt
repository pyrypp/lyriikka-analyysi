I wished for a simple faith
You gave me devotion
I took you to the edge of world
You only ask for more as we
Soaked in the autumn rain
Froze in the lap of snow
Suffered through the April's cruelty
Blinded by the fury of the sun
We roam where the day's eternal and sun nocturnal
We roam where the sun is swallowed and day devoured
Darklings craving
Horns up hailing
We soar together
As burning feathers
Darklings craving
Horns up hailing
We soar together
As burning feathers tonight
We stumble down gloomy paths
Empty gaze of the abyss
Piling up darksome burden
But there's no regret, no remorse
We settle for nothing short of greatness of die trying
The candle burns at both ends not minding it all hurts
When days ahead become ashes of the past
Burning desire defies my memories
I shall offer you a handful of dust
We remember both the diamonds and rust
I shall offer you a handful of dust
We remember both the diamonds and rust
We roam
We roam where the day's eternal and sun nocturnal
We roam where the sun is swallowed and day devoured
Darklings craving
Horns up hailing
We soar together
As burning feathers
Darklings craving
Horns up hailing
Bound together
We roar forever
