They turn the clock back, they seize the time
In the year zero no room for the sublime
Dusk rests upon us, the years of red twilight
Force us to submit and wither deep down inside

For an anthem I sing, for a word I speak
I'll be rewarded in the dark corridor
For a line I write, for a thought I think
I'll be rewarded with a bullet through my neck
I must forget my name, leave past behind
I’m crawling at their feet in this genocide
Death is the only rule, with pain they feed
I’m torn up by the roots like a poisoned weed

Hammering hand over the land grinds us to dust
Cuts every life short
Whispering chant over the land echoes and fades
Here only the silent survive
Pain, starvation, sick creation
Piles of skulls and bones
I see it all
They turn the clock back, they seize the time
In the year zero no room for the sublime
Dusk rests upon us, the years of red twilight
Force us to submit and wither deep down inside
