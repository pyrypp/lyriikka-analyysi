Oh, the travesty of life
Perpetual carnal flame rendered motionless
Unleash the fateful might
The essence that holds the stars in place

With grace, Iâ€™ll enter your realm
Send trembles from afar
Unravel mysteries
With magic in your eyes
Traversing mysteries of motion unveiled
Oh, the dance of the flames
Struggling on the verge of consciousness
Aura of burning flesh
The innocence so pleasantly defiled

Unravel mysteries
With magic in your eyes

Oh, how jaded I am
Oh, how torn is flesh, so motionless
Again and again
I will defy fate, ignite the flame
