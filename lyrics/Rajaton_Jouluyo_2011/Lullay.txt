Where the sun is gold as corn
That's the land where Christ was born
Shining hot from early in the morning
In the north the winter's grey
Winter sun is far away
Snow can come and go without a warning
Hiljaa, hiljaa, lullabye your baby soft and low
Hiljaa, hiljaa, lullabye for moon and Chistmas snow
In the morning Mary mild
Saw the sunlight kiss her child
Tenderly she smiled to watch the noon rise
In my silver northern land
Sun won't come at my command
Hold my baby up to watch the moon rise
Hiljaa, hiljaa, lullabye your baby soft and low
Hiljaa, hiljaa, lullabye for moon and Chistmas snow
I feel sorry that Jesus never had
The chance to breathe his breath
On the window and watch
His life become a blossom
Of silver and with a finger write
His name in a line of starlight
Hiljaa, hiljaa, lullabye your baby soft and low
Hiljaa, hiljaa, lullabye for moon and Chistmas snow
