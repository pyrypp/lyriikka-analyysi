Take this one overdose, take this one over
Take that one overdose, take me all over you
Alone she bleeds out her broken heart
Killing all dreams in every nightmare
Dying inside every waking moment
Lost souls, dancing in the grand ball

Can you feel the tranquility
Redeemers around your naked body
Crucified with tears of disgrace
Kisses of longing dancing on your face
Traitors say, traitors command
Traitors, the rule of our lives
Meaningless and forgotten words

Let me see you burn
Let me fuel your fire
Let me feel your body
Let me see you dance
This is your grand ball
Let me see you burn
Let me fuel your fire
Let me feel your body
Let me see you dance
This is your grand ball

Take this one overdose, take this one over
Take that one overdose, me inside of you
Take a step forward, never look back
Traitors say, traitors command
Contaminate you until the day you die
Traitors, the rule of our lives

Let me feel your body
Let me see you dance
Let me fuel your fire
Let me see you burn
Let me see you dance
This is your grand ball
Let me see you burn
Let me fuel your fire
Let me see you burn
Let me see you dance
This is your grand ball
Let me see you burn
Let me fuel your fire
Let me feel your body
Let me see you dance
This is your grand ball
Let me see you burn
Let me fuel your fire
Let me feel your body
Let me see you dance
This is your grand ball
