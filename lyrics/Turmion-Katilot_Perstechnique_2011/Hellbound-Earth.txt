I would like to thank everybody
Who has been supporting me
In this genocide of my kind
Baby bye bye

Stick your head up into your ass
You pile of shit
You pile of human shit
I despise you

I watch your bleed, I'm here to feed
I crush your black and wounded soul
I want you dead, I break your neck
I burn your eyes and cut your throat
I will save your, hellbound earth

For every tear that falls
Your end, gets closer
Everyone wants to go to heaven
But nobody wants to die

Nature, a pile of human shit
Universe, a pile of human shit

I watch your bleed, I'm here to feed
I crush your black and wounded soul
I want you dead, I break your neck
I burn your eyes and cut your throat
I will save your, hellbound earth

Stick your head up into your ass
You pile of shit
You pile of human shit
I despise you
