Come inna di Dance wid the stick a Sensi
Down wid the sound called Brigante
Anybody wanna be fast but dem a dun know me
Governor assimilating a wannabe-chopper mc

Gimi the pick and i gi dem lobotomy
Choppin em up like a episiotomy
Keep a philosophy: epistemology
Viral pandemic a trap-etymology (tr-epidemiology)
I´m a targaryen egalitarian
Tell her mi bury dem, word to the prophecy
Genna barbarian, step in a fairy tale
Scalpin em, open a skull, hang em up in it

Anybody wid em anybody gonna buggin
When the governor mi hit em
Wid the betaparticle and when i get upon the biorythm
Anybody gonna bite a motherfucker like I-man a metabolism
I generally gi dem manna, mi nuh mind a manner
Man a mentor any man a any man a better be wid it
So when i get upon the dance seh di gyal a gonna bonx butt
Woman a better
Uno better babble a riddle
Dem a comin off key like a metric system
You get upon the governor palace, You better be savage, I mangle a menace
Sumn a dem a jackin em bars deh by the enemy, dem a nuh bad ass
Rather gonna dead em wid a telekinetic ability
I gonna scatter any motherfuckin brain till em a van a go vanish
A wagon a damaged
No mi nuh gonna bore dem wid them regular patterns
Uno better be get em a xanax
Gonna batter the challenge, Governor metamorphin to a demogorgon
Man a headless horseman, No mi nuh manipulate
Man a choppin em all, cuz dem a fake like a Ester-orphan
Open a portal a governor a immortal a iman immortal combat a mortal
A governor a pickin a mic in party a venom a kill em hostel
(tew! tew! tew!)
Anybody get upon the rythm, but the governor mi dead em inna postal

Anybody talkin like eminem a the venom but deh
Anybody know who did a fill em wid the venom and eliminate em
Other word: dehumilate em
With a machete maiden, I don't want to hurt'em but I kill 'em inna game
A Governor incinerate, dumpin a body in the lake
Im murderin again and mi nuh gonna do a fill-in
Mi nuh Slim, I renegade em
Twin a made em so I minute maid em
Been upon the radar man a been amazin
Governor a giger wid the fingerpaint
I never been a minute man, I mek a punny levitate
Upon the motherfuckin wall deh, A nuh anybody finna the godzilla shady
Fuk em! Only Dumanoid hell a crazy, Well I put em in the middle
Particular pickney a dead em wid the telekinetic ability
I´m Eleven and I put em pon the guillotine deh
Anybody dyin´ like in Lucky number slevin
Lethal wid the weapon

Stop the toxic masculinity!
Car pull up like it a dead to me...
Dem wanna go fast i wanna go hard lyrically wid a melody (remedy)

Get upon the riddim a nuh body gonna leavin/livin
Mi nuh go leavin a witness, mi nuh mickey mi nuh mallory
A general a dead em inna minnies haberdashery
So governor gotta be killin mi nuh believin inna jealousy
R.A. the rugged man said I´m fuckin above a them
A nuh even dadda vinnie dida pass on me
And anybody want it coulda get it
Man a mek a motherfuckin mother bawlin like bohemian rapsody

Anybody wanna be the don deh wid the headset
Tellin mi: "i chibber" while em chibber like a redneck
Governor come in gotta be the don deh whe a badass
Stay upon the comments, never tink you been a bad ass
Tellin mi: "I´m offbeat", but their fuckin posse
Miss any hat/head like a Sleepy Hollow pon tree
Must be. Developin a complex. Mosby
Governor gonna be choppin a head off like Joffrey
Now let mi catch a slow breath
Anybody sound like em made up words when dem go fast
You sound like: Packin a mac inna back a the ac and ya ya takin in it back
And ya ya breakin the neck and ya bigger the better and lobotomize and I'm choppin ya head
I´m a real Hip Hopper, yuh a windowshopper
Ur recording weak, ur production cheap
I´m Interchopper, I´m Sabotahe
I´m Rugged Man, Afro, Midwest Chopper
And he will crush ya brain
He will chop ya skull, inna locker
Pon the 5th a vodka inna Nicaragua
Like I´m Mrs Dr. Pimplepopper
Let mi interrupt ya
Yu nuh singin propper wid the jibber jabber
And the demon-backup
And mi never gonna be a part again a them choppertracks
Unless N9na holla, Rakim, Busta and Twista follow
Nuff luv to splxtsecond and dumanoid
Anyone else step your level up... *suku-voice*

Eminem never been the fastest
It was fi a hitsong not a fast track
So better count them syllables right
Yeah yuh fast but the sound and the lyrics nuh tight

Ruffian Rugged: now let mi kill the shit
Noise cut: aaah
Twisted Insane: steppin it up
