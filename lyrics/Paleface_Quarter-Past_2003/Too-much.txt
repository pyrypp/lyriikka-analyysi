I Keep Forgetting That You're Mine

In-Debt Daniel
Welcome To The West Side
Different From The Other Side
I Think That It's About Time
That You Should Keep Your Eyes Away
In-Debt Daniel
Oh, There He Goes Again
In-Debt Daniel
In-Debt Daniel
What A Fellow
Cross Your Eyes
And Tell Me
Your Lies
Oh Wait, I Forgot Again
That, That's Who I Am
In-Debt Daniel
I Look to The Sky And
All the time I Forget
That there's nothing up there
I Look Around My Room
I Forgеt Which Side Is Up Again
I Just Can't Really Think About It too Much

Prefacе It
Complacent
Contemplation
And Falling In Line
And You Are Falling Behind
And You Are Falling Behind
And You Are Falling Behind

I wish I could view the world
The same way that you do
But You never really look at it the way that I do
It's always so one-sided and it's not really fair To me
I don't know
San Francisco!
Why do you have be this way
Why can't make a ride affordable
Without a co-pay
Living on the sideline
Calling us a mistake
Living off the disdain
Falling off the list, eh?
So why don't you tell them what you've done over the past few months
Instead you ride off the charges and kneel on the grave
Like the boy you raised

Oh My, You just wanna be alright
And Oh My, This isn’t right
Come with me my friend
This will be alright
You will have a flight
You will be alright
All of this time
I’ve known you my whole life, now
All of my life I’ve known
You are not alone
You are at home
You are in the right
You will know in time
This will be alright
