CHORUS
Every day I skate
In a new Location
Every night I skate
Find a new Rotation
Every day I skate
In a new Location
Every night I skate
Find a new Rotation
VERSE 1
Sidewalk and I'm going going
Ride off and I'm gone
Time stops and I'm rolling rolling
Wheels lock I stay on
Cold breeze and it's blowing blowing
GNV wind strong
Time keeps on flowing flowing
Skating 'til the break of dawn
But I don't really know
What time I'd go home
I would just skate at night
Play a few beats on my phone
(Fast)
Real Slim Shady
Instrumentals
Headphones in
Freestyle in the mental
Bars going
Straight thru my head
One kick
I would fly ahead
Norman Hall
Lib West
Where I'd skate in the daytime
But at night
Architecture courtyard's
Where I'd set my sights
Slide to the Fine Arts building too
I would skate up and down
Jacket whipping as the wind blew
Sometimes I'd hit the ground
But I'd get right back up though
Wouldn't let anything stop me
Ryan gave me his Pennyboard
And skating became a hobby
Over time I learned how to do it
It was all about that balance
Yeezys on my feet
I was king of my palace, I'd
BRIDGE
Skate Skate Skate Skate
Push off the ground
Skate Skate Skate Skate
Ride thru the town, cause
CHORUS
Every day I skate
In a new Location
Every night I skate
Find a new Rotation
Every day I skate
In a new Location
Every night I skate
Find a new Rotation
VERSE 2
Few times Nick slid thru
We would ride on his longboards
Every night tried something new
See we never got bored
Top of Reitz parking garage
All throughout campus
Couple times got dislodged
In the grass feel the dampness
Rode down a couple hills
One time almost got killed
Going down Stadium Road
Tryna improve our skills
Down at the bottom East Hall
We didn't make it there
Fell off close to the top
Bus missed the boards by a hair
That's one of the bad times
But I'm glad I never tried to quit
Skateboarding is a way of life
And straight up I vibe with it
Four wheels and lots of fun
Used to cruise with no sun
Ride around at nighttime
No distractions on my mind
Bricks fly by under the wheels
Going fast I'll keep it real
Couldn't go down the big hills
Facts man you know the deal
Call myself experienced
Certainly not skilled
If we're being serious
The danger of it all thrilled
It's exciting reigniting
Memories in these songs
I'm writing Reuniting
With the days long gone
Skating's one of a kind
To the sport I was drawn
Helps me free my mind
As I ride along cause
END CHORUS
Every day I skate
In a new Location
Every night I skate
Find a new Rotation
Every day I skate
In a new Location
Every night I skate
Find a new Rotation
