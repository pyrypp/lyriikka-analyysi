I've been laying in this wreck since the dawn of days
And it's been playing with my head in a million different ways
I hardly ever get a minute to my thoughts alone
Before they're clambering on the roof or making something out of bone
Well since they made this their home
It's no longer my own
Now I'm not welcome in this house of spirits anymore, baby
Now I'm not welcome in this house of spirits anymore, baby
There are buzzards in the belfry always aiming for their mark
And countless other unhinged voices in this palace after dark
They took the timber off the roof, and now it's filling up with rain
And whatever burrowed through my head has made its way outside again
Well since they made this their home
It's no longer my own
Now I'm not welcome in this house of spirits anymore, baby
Now I'm not welcome in this house of spirits anymore, baby
That's why I wrote you this letter staring back from the page
Saying I won't stay another minute and I will not be redeemed
And I know that I love you
I love you
I love you
It's just lately it ain't been the same here without you
It's just lately it ain't been the same here without you
Well since they made this their home
It's no longer my own
You can tell from the look in their eyes, oh my love
They won't let me out dead or alive, no my love
I'm going to wait 'til they've gone to ground, oh my love
Then I'll burn this mad house down
