You or me is going down tonight
I'm not gonna bend without the fight
I won’t stop even if you beg
And now It's too late because you're dead
I break your bones and shoot through your knees
I pierce your eyes so that you can see
I peel off your skin, I rip off your flesh
I feed you to dogs

Do you feel me, do you feel me now?
What is left of you to love?
Did you feel me, did you feel me ever?
Do you feel me, do you feel me now?
What is left of you to love?
Did you feel me, did you feel me ever?

Do you feel me, can you hear my voice?
Do you feel me, this isn’t a choice
You gave yourself up, but you didn't surrender
So I have to finish this game

Don't dare to speak to me again
You are just a backseat driver
You'll lose more than you could ever have
Don't turn your back on me. I hate stupidity
You are so weak, that it makes me sick
You have only asses to lick
Obey my rules or else...
You have released the hell

Do you feel me, do you feel me now?
What is left of you to love?
Did you feel me, did you feel me ever?
Do you feel me, do you feel me now?
What is left of you to love?
Did you feel me, did you feel me ever?

I'm supernatural. This is ecstasy
You can take my life, but you can't kill me
I'm god of my own world
Can you kill someone
Who’s already dead inside without guide
Do you feel me? Kill me! Do you feel me now!?
Death doesn’t bother me
What is left of you to love?
Did you feel me, did you feel me ever?
But can you kill someone whose love is already dead?
