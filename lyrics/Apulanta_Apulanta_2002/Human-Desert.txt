Now enter the silence, 'cause it's alright
So now you've wasted the guidance, but it's alright
I wanna something more, but it's alright
I wanna be something more, I guess it's alright
Who's to say the love is true
And who's to blame when no-one found it
All alone in here
Confusion's all I see
Truth, the one I fear
Confusion's all in me
Don't mind the silence, 'cause it's alright
It's only fake defiance, guess it's alright
I wanna something more, but it's alright
I wanna feel something more, guess it's alright
Who's to say my aim is true
And who's to find the way right through you
All alone in here
Confusion's all I see
Truth, the one I fear
Confusion's all in me
My vow, I know I'm gonna break it
I know, I'm only gonna fake it
You don't ever wanna take it
I know, I'm only gonna fake it
My vow, I know I'm gonna break it
I know, I'm only gonna fake it
You don't ever wanna take it
I know, I'm only gonna fake it
Who's to say my aim is true
And who's to find the way right through you
All alone in here
Confusion's all I see
Truth, the one I fear
Confusion's all in me
