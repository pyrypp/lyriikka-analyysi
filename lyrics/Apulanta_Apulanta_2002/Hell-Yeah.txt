Taste the bile down in my throat
Be the flea I'll be your goat
Raining down from stars above
Endless streams of plastic love
Feel the core that's melting down
See the fools are wearing crowns
Twist the blade you sank in me
Sleep again with the enemy
You mess me up and shoot me down
But I'll go fighting
The dirty heads roll in the ground
But keep on biting
The cloud is closing in my shade
The one that follows you just won't go away
Fear is in your eyes to stay
Who's to blame in the end of the day
Time to rise up in the sky
Time to bridge those walls too high
Time to bring down the evil king
Time to feel this hovering
You mess me up and shoot me down
But I'll go fighting
The dirty heads roll in the ground
But keep on biting
