We'll go together into the dark woods
Sinking with wise old tree roots
How I want to unlearn
I don't want old branches no more
Every tooth is broken
And all of the flesh is burnt
I've wounded my side
And I've wound in my hide
Don't ask what is the price of my hand
Would you be queen of my land?
When everyone else is gone
Fire, making my way much harder
All of this time I'm after
Images of my soul
And I've wounded my side
And I've wounded my hide
And I've got snakes in my eyes
And I've got snakes in my mind, mind
Peace of my mind is cast in iron
Come on now baby, ride on
Down to the root of life, life
No, no, don't give me more of your glow
Come on now baby, ride on
Down the joys of my night, night
And I've wounded my side
And I've wounded my hide
And I've got snakes in my eyes
And I've got snakes in my mind, mind
No, no, ..., die
I'm not too far down
I'm not too far gone
