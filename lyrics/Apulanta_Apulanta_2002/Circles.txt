Life in this world with codes of bars
Feels like you're a fly trapped in a jar
The walls just keep on closing in
So fucking cheap is everything
Run around in circles all your life
Doing all those things you don't know why
All the faith in good been burned by fire
But you know you must keep crawling on and on
There's nothing more than shades of gray
No feeling in those brand new scales
Screams just get louder in your brain
We ride on deeper down the drain
Run around in circles all your life
Doing all those things you don't know why
All the faith in good been burned by fire
But you know you must keep crawling on and on
