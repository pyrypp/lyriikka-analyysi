I don't know if I want to flow for evermore
And I don't want to know how slow the time must flow
And I don't want to hear no cheap apologies
And I don't want to wish for anything more
Within myself I lost myself
It's not my mind that's in my head
Within my shell without my soul
It is my head but not my mind
You know your way around the fools' hall of fame
You say you're all for it, you're not in for the game
It is so hard to try not to look into the flame
It is so hard to keep all boogie nights at bay
Within myself I lost myself
It's not my mind that's in my head
Within my shell without my soul
It's not my mind in my head
Come and go and spin around
And throw it up and throw it down
And someone's always higher up than you
Within myself I lost myself
It's not my mind that's in my head
Within my shell without my soul
It is my head but not my mind
