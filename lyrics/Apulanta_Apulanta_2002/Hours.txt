The night I'm all fucking fucked up
The night when all the stars fell down
The night is nails back in my skin
So goddamn true, there's just too much time
The night is all eternity
The night that burns my eyes like fire
The night when demons laugh at me
So goddamn true, it's just too much time
You don't fucking deserve me
There is just too much time
