Ch
I am your Juliet - You are my Romeo
Your love gives me ride like a rodeo
In the dark of night, you told me it's over now
And soon I'll be alright, but you didn't tell me when or how
You tried to tell me a lie, but i found the real thorn you're
Only reason why is the neighbourhood where I was born
Ch
Your father knows it best - I can only make you sad
'cos I am unlike the rest, and don't know how to please your dad
If you stay on his side, I will be gone for good. But I
Know, you'll take a ride to my side of the neighbourhood
Ch
The only way I can live my life is pain, since I can't see you again
The secret place, forbidden love, forbidden games - it lasted only days
Ch
