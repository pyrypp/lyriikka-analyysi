Soul seekers are on the way
Heaven lays down and surrender
Gods swear in the name of us
Infernal power of making love
Behind the scenes everything's real
Opportunity to a never know level
Lust immortal, pain eternal
Revolution, symphony of pleasure
Open up your naked body
Surrender for my punishment
Slaver, between your legs
Begging for the salvation
Enter, ejaculate, exterminate, evacuate
Screaming, vibrating
Orgasmic dance of the body and mind
Distortion of me, disordering you
We feel the same... Pain...
Corruption of yours, corrupting me
We're killing the same... Pain...
Take my hand and join me
In this eternal damnation of lust
Hear my scream
Like a flame dance the night away
Through the line, close your eyes
Let these worlds collide
Hear my scream
Like a flame dance the night away
Through the line, close your eyes
Let these worlds collide
Rule forever, dance together
Lust immortal, pain immortal
Rule forever, dance together
Take my hand and join me in this eternal damnation of lust
I am closer, your moisture lips
Inch by inch diving deeper
Sexual grand-opening
Addicted to these bodies reaction
Eyes more radiant than the moon
As she collapses in my arms
Nature kneels down today
The higher moment just for you
Souls touching, each others
Becoming as one as ment to be
Eyes more radiant than the stars
As we collapse into this sin
