Love me
Touch me
Hate me
Never leave me
Love me
Touch me
Hate me
Forever yours
Let us be shelter of our wounds
Now and then we get lost from reality
Common toughts drives us to insane
Be my sanitarium, be my immortal
There is no future, there is no past
Hand in hand we arise from the dust
I am the razorblade inside your veins
Our blood is my life, so let it rain
Side by side we are the higher force
Our hands testifies integrated souls
Chaos masterpiece of two mens creation
Total demolition, loud laughter for life
Navigating inside, inside of you
Crawling in the edge of insanity
I need the razorblade to feed my veins
Our love is my blood so let it rain
Waiting for you
Navigating, navigating, navigating
Inside of you
The rain from the bloodred sky
I need the razorblade to feed my veins
Still waiting alone
Navigating, navigating, navigating
Inside of you
The blood for the sacred alliance
I need the razorblade to feed my veins
Raise your hands, touch the skies
Creatures deep in the rotten soul
Burned alive, forgive, forever
So called role of the humans face
Raise the skies...
Masturbation activated by the power of hate
Burned alive forever
Radiation in the eyes of the fallen angels
Cum, ames, non sapias, aut cum sapias
Non ames, erare humanun, est ignosere divinum
Nemo enim feres saltat sobrius
Nisi forte insanit
Omnia vinsint amor, inter arma silent leges
Nemo enim feres saltat sobrius
Nisi forte insanit
Omnia vinsint amor, abimale spiritus
Hand in hand we arise from the dust
I am the razorblade inside your veins
Our blood is my life, so let it rain
There is no future, there is no past
Hand in hand my immortal...
Love me
Touch me
Hate me
Never leave me
Love me
Touch me
Hate me
Forever yours
My immortal, our blood is my life so let it rain
