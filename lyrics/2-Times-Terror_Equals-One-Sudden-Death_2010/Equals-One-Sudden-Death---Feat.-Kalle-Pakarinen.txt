Life was hanging around a while
You were blessed and my own saint
Without own reason, you were so depend on others
The pressure too much to carry
You waved and slept away, slept away
Life was hanging around a while
Without own reason, you were so depend on others
Never see your eyes, never seen your smile
Never near me

Love is still here it keeps you near me
Never forgive, never stop thinking
You are with me, every lonely moment
Life equals one sudden death tonight
Love you so much, miss you even more
Pain without you, is so much to handle
I placed you to the stars, I burried you in to my soul
I won't forget, I will never forget
Be in my dreams, stay in my soul
Let my body suffer, just come back to my arms
Come back, come back, my fearless child
Over come my faith

Love is still here it keeps you near me
Never forgive, never stop thinking
You are with me, every lonely moment
Life equals one sudden death tonight
