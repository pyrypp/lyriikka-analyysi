When our virtues fall
At night we hear the silent call
Of Soul Destroyer
My mouth is made of silence
Yet I speak with Her tongue
These words of destruction
This song of perdition
The words of destruction
This song of perdition
To you it's a gateway
Into my world
My sight black, luminescent
Immersion, the dark current
When our virtues fall
At night we hear the silent call
Of Soul Destroyer
The highest of the holiest
She is the most feared
The pulse of the red tide
This madness of nightside
The pulse of the red tide
This madness of nightside
Tonight she is here
She is drawing near
Summon Her, no names
She follows, no names
And when misanthropy fit shall fall
Sudden from the heart like a weeping fire
That decries the droop-headed followers all
And roars liberty in these times so dire
Then glut thy anger let it interpose
As a sword to sever slave from the soul
Or as a wall between you and those
Human sewers making world a hellhole
When our virtues fall
At night we hear the silent call
Of Soul Destroyer
