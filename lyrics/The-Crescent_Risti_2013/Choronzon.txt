Night born out of funeral pyre
Flames within growing higher
Twilight in fire - Twilight of desire
Night born out of funeral pyre
Night born out of funeral pyre
Flames within smothering the liar
Paradise in fire - paradise of wormy mire
Night born out of funeral pyre
Ye lord of fire
Burn the altars in heavens
Ye lord of air
Unleash storms and ravens
Ye lord of earth
Trample down the divine 7
Ye lord of water
Flood upon the holy havens
Night born out of funeral pyre
Flames within smothering the liar
Paradise in fire - paradise of wormy mire
Night born out of funeral pyre
Ye lord of fire
Burn the altars in heavens
Ye lord of air
Unleash storms and ravens
Ye lord of earth
Trample down the divine 7
Ye lord of water
Flood upon the holy havens
To see the dying of one's soul light
To enter the sacred ceremonial night
To witness the birth of our endless night
To enter the sacred ceremonial light
Night born out of funeral pyre
Flames within growing higher
Twilight in fire - Twilight of desire
Night born out of funeral pyre
Night born out of funeral pyre
Flames within smothering the liar
Paradise in fire - paradise of wormy mire
Night born out of funeral pyre
