Today I found my mind in a line ready to be fried
My amputated legs have left me lying in the landslide
Happiness from satellites is happiness for all us termites
Hunger keeps on growing and becomes the master
Confiscated, underrated
Oh, my time is nigh
No don't leave no witnesses alive
Take away this guilt, I beg you, feed it to the fire
Take away my blindfold, let me see who is the liar
Confiscated, underrated
Oh, my time is nigh
Just don't leave no witnesses alive
Devastating, excruciating, wash away my sins
Tomorrow's world is for no such thing as me
Confiscated, underrated
Oh, my time is nigh
Just don't leave no witnesses alive
Devastating, excruciating, wash away my sins
Tomorrow's world is for no such thing as me
