Eternity is every heartbeat crawling over me
Silence is too loud, it's like a thunder in my ears
Curl up lie down close your eyes, wait for the hit to come
All quiet on the western front
Trade all my love for one dive in the light
After all these burns I welcome the night
Come, drift away now with me
Trading myself for nothing
It's so easy to lose yourself in the empty eyes
Cover up your face, don't meet the crowd with no disguise
In the end there is no right, just variants of wrong
I'm still waiting for the cavalry
Trade all my love for one dive in the light
After all these burns I welcome the night
Come, drift away now with me
Trading myself for nothing
