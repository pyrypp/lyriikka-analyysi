Tear me apart to gain control
You know I have two faces
You can choose the one you want
Oh, I know I climb too high
I want to see the sun
Drown in my world
Drown in my world
Drown in my world
Drown in my world
Drown in my world
All those ghosts we thought were gone
They all came back to stay
To stay for evermore
Oh, I know I fly too close
I want to feel the flame
Drown in my world
Drown in my world
Drown in my world
Drown in my world
Drown in my world
Oh, I know I fly too close
I want to feel the flame
Drown in my world
Drown in my world
Drown in my world
Drown in my world
Drown in my world
