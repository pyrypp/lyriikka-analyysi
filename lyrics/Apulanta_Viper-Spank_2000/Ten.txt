Recycle us just one more time
Once again now
Peel off the dead skin one more time
Once again now
I have seen it happen
I should have known it matters
Outrace the clock for the final time
Closing time now
Think twice before you say the word
Closing time now
I have seen it happen
I should have known it matters
Come on out on my empty street
Welcome home, you're the first I meet
It's useless to say that you're sorry
Just don't get down on your knees
Throw out your chance to win the prize
Like the heroes
Greatest of all is sacrifice
Like the heroes
I have seen it happen
I should've known it matters
Come on out on my empty street
Welcome home, you're the first I meet
It's useless to say that you're sorry
Just don't get down on your knees
Crack my shell open one more time
Just to find out
I'm not the one to clean the grime
Just to find out
I have seen it happen
I should have known it matters
Come on out on my empty street
Welcome home, you're the first I meet
It's useless to say that you're sorry
Just don't get down on your knees
