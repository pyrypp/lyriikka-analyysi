I don't know about using plastercine
To close my wounds or to hold the smile on my face
Meaningless hours turn into meaningless years
Meaningless promises to meaningless fears
Show me your answers, baby, show me the light
Show me the goal and I will get there on my own
Fallout, all inside your words
Fallout, deep inside of you
Fallout in my world is made of your lies
Fallout pouring down on me
How much more can the sewers hold inside
Reincarnated evil never meant to hide
Meaningless words turn to meaningless truth
Meaningless acts of love to meaningless you
Blood is the answer, baby, blood is the light
Deny me the door and I will find my own way out
Fallout, all inside your words
Fallout, deep inside of you
Fallout in my world is made of your lies
Fallout pouring down on me
Fallout, all inside your words
Fallout, deep inside of you
Fallout in my world is made of your lies
Fallout pouring down on me
