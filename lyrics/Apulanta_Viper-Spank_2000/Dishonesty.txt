I, I think I wrote you yesterday
It makes no difference anyway
Maybe I should inhale the steam
Maybe you drown me in this dream
If I can take you home tonight
I promise you we don't have to fight
Survival is secondary to
Havin' it all again with you
All of my days
All of my days are turning blue
All of my days I wait and wonder
Dishonesty
Your every word eats up a small part of me
I know your game and I just can't get enough
I don't wanna work it out
I don't wanna work it out
With you
All, all of the monkeys in the row
All of the monkeys love you so
What is the name I heard you call
Down is the way all objects fall
I got it all for the price of one
I know that my war has just begun
Every day's a brand new day
Or just a brand new yesterday
All of my days
All of my days are turning blue
All of my days I wait and wonder
Dishonesty
Your every word eats up a small part of me
I know your game and I just can't get enough
I don't wanna work it out
I don't wanna work it out
With you
Dishonesty
Your every smile brings out the fool that's in me
I know you kill me I just can't get enough
I don't wanna work it out
I don't wanna work it out
With you
All of my days
All of my days are turning blue
All of my days I wait and wonder
Dishonesty...
