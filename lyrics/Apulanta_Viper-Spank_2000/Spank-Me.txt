Spank me...
Spank me...
Your dirty finger used to make me happy
Now the shining ones are pointing at me
And they all say, you are not alone here
So they all say, so they say to me
Spank me, hey turn me over baby
Spank me, hey turn me over baby
Spank me, hey would you do it to me
The visitors in my head keep telling me
About the world that is not for us to see
And they all say, say that I'm an angel
So they all say, so they say to me
Spank me, hey turn me over baby
Spank me, hey turn me over baby
Spank me, hey would you do it to me
Mechano of love is all that you've been living for
Inside your mind there is a room that has no door
Mechano love is all that you've been waiting for
Your happy friend will make it alright again
Spank me, hey turn me over baby
Spank me, hey turn me over baby
Spank me, hey would you do it to me
Why don't you do it to me
Why don't you do it to me
Why don't you do it to me
