What is this cold dagger in my guts
What's the name of this fear inside
Like a parasite it feeds itself
How much longer 'til it's everything?
Turn out the lights before I enter
And I just turn my radar on
The only thing that seems to matter
Is how we read between the lines
The truth is hiding somewhere behind your words
But your snake-tongue leads me easily astray
Thou shalt not suffer the witch to live
I just got to find the final proof
Turn out the lights before I enter
And I just turn my radar on
The only thing that seems to matter
Is how we read between the lines
Scent of your betrayal in the bedroom
Reminds me of the sweet smell of you and me
Turn off the lights before I enter
And I just turn my radar on
The only thing that seems to matter
Is how we read between the lines
