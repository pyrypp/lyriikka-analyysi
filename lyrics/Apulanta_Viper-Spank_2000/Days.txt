Stay, or don't stay
Come around, and join my party
Come, rub the salt in my wounds
In love again
With the sound of distant laughter
You made us beautiful
Made us strong
Days when I love you
Days when I crave to be with you
Days when I scream
Days when I bleed
A world full of pearls
And a star for us to follow
Screams in the dreams woke us up
Things that you do
Like the sand between your fingers
You made us beautiful
Made us torn
Days when I love you
Days when I crave to be with you
Days when I scream
Days when I bleed
Calling your name in the night
The shadows answer
Leave what is left for the crows
Take what you take
But the beast is always hungry
You made us beautiful
Made us dead
Days when I love you
Days when I crave to be with you
Days when I scream
Days when I bleed
Days when I love you
Days when I love you
Days when I love you
Days when I love you
