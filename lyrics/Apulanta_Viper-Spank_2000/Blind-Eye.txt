I thought I found it
But I know it's just a fake
The chain that holds you
It might bend, but it won't break
Underneath the paint lies the true picture
Wipe it all away, wipe it all today
Blind eye
The only blind eye
Wide open blind eye
Look at me blind eye
You are my blind eye
Neon fire
Is my sun and is my star
On the chessboard
You can never run too far
You have initiated the virus download
Make it now complete, feed it all in me
Blind eye
The only blind eye
Wide open blind eye
Look at me blind eye
You are my blind eye
And you know you should always trust a friend
Just a scratch and
You will bleed until the end
Beauty is a needle to my balloon
I want to explode, I'll get to ...
Blind eye
The only blind eye
Wide open blind eye
Look at me blind eye
You are my blind eye
