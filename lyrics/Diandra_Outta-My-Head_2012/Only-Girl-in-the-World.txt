I want you to love me, like I'm a hot ride
Keep thinkin' of me, doin' what you like
So boy forget about the world cause it's gon' be me and you tonight
I wanna make you beg for it, then I'ma make you swallow your pride
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that's in command
Cause I'm the only one who understands
How to make you feel like a man
Yeah
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only one
Want you to take me like a thief in the night
Hold me like a pillow, make me feel alright
Baby I'll tell you all my secrets that I'm keepin' and you can come inside
And when you enter, you ain't leavin', be my prisoner for the night
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that's in command
Cause I'm the only one who understands
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only one
Take me for a ride
Oh baby, take me high
Let me make you first
Oh make it last all night
Take me for a ride
Oh baby, take me high
Let me make you first
Make it last all night
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that's in command
Cause I'm the only one who understands
How to make you feel like a man
Only girl in the world
Girl in the world
