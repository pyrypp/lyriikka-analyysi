Listen
To the song here in my heart
A melody I start but can't complete
Listen
To the sound from deep within
It's only beginning
To find release
Oh, the time has come
For my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own
All cause you won't listen
Listen
I am alone at a crossroad
I'm not at home in my own home
And I tried and tried to say what's on my mind
And you should have known
Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
And now I've gotta find my own
Oh you should have listened
There is someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago
Oh, I'm screaming out and my dreams'll be heard
They will not be pushed aside on words
Into your own all 'cause you won't
Listen
Listen
I am alone at a crossroad
I'm not at home in my own home
And I tried and tried to say what's on my mind
And you should have known
Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
And now I've gotta find my own
I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't
If you won't
Listen
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start but I will complete
Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice that you gave to me
And now I've gotta find my own
My own
