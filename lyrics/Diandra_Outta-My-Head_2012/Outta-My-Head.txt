SINCE YOU BROKE UP WITH ME BABY
I GO OUT EVERY NIGHT
AND I SPEND ALL OF MY MONEY
ON WHATEVER I LIKE
SINCE YOU BROKE UP WITH ME BABY
SINCE YOU BROKE UP WITH ME BABY
AND I TELL ALL OF MY FRIENDS
I AM DOING OK
IT´S BEEN EXACTLY TWO MONTHS
I´VE BEEN COUNTING THE DAYS
SINCE YOU BROKE UP WITH ME BABY
SINCE YOU BROKE UP WITH ME BABY
I WISH I NEVER MET YOU
I´M TRYING TO FORGET YOU
STILL I JUST CAN´T LET GO, GO, GO
I´M RUNNING OFF THE TRACK BOY
AND EVERYTHING IS BLACK BOY
I WANNA HAVE YOU BACK BOY, BOY, AH...
CHORUS:
I´VE TRIED TO ERASE YOU
I´VE TRIED TO REPLACE YOU
BUT I CAN´T GET YOU OUTTA MY HEAD
MY HEART´S TORN TO PIECES
AND I´M SUCH A MESS
I CAN´T GET YOU OUTTA MY HEAD
OUTTA MY HEAD, OUTTA MY HEAD
OUTTA MY HEAD, OUTTA MY HEAD...
SINCE YOU BROKE UP WITH ME BABY
I KNOW I DRINK TOO MUCH
I´D GIVE YOU ALL OF MY MONEY
JUST TO FEEL YOUR TOUCH
I´D GIVE YOU ALL OF MY MONEY
I´D GIVE YOU ALL OF MY MONEY
I WISH I NEVER MET YOU
I´M TRYING TO FORGET YOU
STILL I JUST CAN´T LET GO, GO, GO
I´M RUNNING OFF THE TRACK BOY
AND EVERYTHING IS BLACK BOY
I WANNA HAVE YOU BACK BOY, BOY, BOY AH...
CHORUS
YOU´RE THE ONLY ONE
SO TELL ME WHAT TO DO?
YOU´RE THE ONLY ONE
YOU´RE THE ONLY ONE
NO ONE COMPARES TO YOU
YOU´RE THE ONLY ONE
YOU´RE THE ONLY ONE
CHORUS
