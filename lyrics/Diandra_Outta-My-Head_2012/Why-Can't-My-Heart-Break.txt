He is that boy everyone wants
I can't believe, almost I have it all
He was the one out of my reach
And now that he's here, he's just something I need
He tells me, tells me that he wants me
Holding my hand, but I don't feel a thing
Why can't my heart break, though I want it
Why can't he make me hurt
Why can't I miss him, like I used to
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know
Why can't my heart break
He's all that I want, there when I need
I don't understand that it's not enough
All that it's left, (?)
I never felt this way before about him
But I tell him, tell him that I want him
Holding his hand and he don't know a thing
Why can't my heart break, though I want it
Why can't he make me hurt
Why can't I miss him, like I used to
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know
Why can't my heart break
Why, why can't he want somebody else
To make my heart break, make it realize
Why, is there no turning back
I just wanna feel something
Why can't my heart break, though I want it
Why can't he make me hurt
Why can't I miss him, like I used to
I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know
Why can't my heart break, though I want it
Why can't he make me hurt
Why can't I miss him, like I used to
I don't know, I don't know
Said I don't know, I don't know
Why can't my heart break
