What have you done to me
I'm staring at the ceiling
I need a plaster for the heart
To stop the bleeding
Cause everywhere I see your face
I wonder who will take my place
Why did you go?
I need some answers now
To get on by
Please tell me why did you go
All these questions why
Stuck inside my mind
Yeah yeah
Why, a reason why
Give me a reason
Why, a reason why
Yeah yeah
Why, a reason why
Give me a reason
Why, a reason why
Why, why
And all the things you said to me
I was so damn naive
Now I'm breathing in the dark
I can't believe it
Cause everywhere I see your face
I wonder who will take my place
Why did you go?
I need some answers now
To get on by
Please tell me why did you go
All these questions why
Stuck inside my mind
Yeah yeah
Why, a reason why
Give me a reason
Why, a reason why
Yeah yeah
Why, a reason why
Give me a reason
Why, a reason why
Why, why, why...
Oh oh oh, you are somewhere out there
Oh oh oh, but you don't care about me
Oh oh oh, the more I think about it
I don't understand a thing
Why did you go?
I need some answers now
To get on by
Please tell me why did you go
All these questions why
Stuck inside my mind
Yeah yeah
Why, a reason why
Give me a reason
Why, a reason why
Yeah yeah
Why, a reason why
Give me a reason
Why, a reason why
Yeah yeah
Why, a reason why
Give me a reason
Why, a reason why
Yeah yeah
Why, a reason why
Give me a reason
Why, a reason why
Why, why, why...
