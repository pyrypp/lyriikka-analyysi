So this is it
Looking back over my shoulder
It feels like I'm hit
Like a car just ran me over
Cause we can't go there
Back to where we started in the first place
I try so hard now
But maybe I just can't forget
Baby you get stuck into my heart
Baby you get stuck into my heart
Just like a tattoo
Now it's only tearing me apart
Now it's only tearing me apart
You're like a tattoo on my heart
It's been a while
There's a distance now I'm feeling
I get on by
But time it just won't heal it
I just go there
Back to all the places where we started
New found lovers
I make believe it's you and me
Baby you get stuck into my heart
Baby you get stuck into my heart
Just like a tattoo
Now it's only tearing me apart
Now it's only tearing me apart
You're like a tattoo on my heart
I remember staying up late
I remember music we played
The memory of us never fades
It will never fade away
Baby you get stuck into my heart
Baby you get stuck into my heart
Baby you get stuck into my heart
Just like a tattoo
Now it's only tearing me apart
Now it's only tearing me apart
You're like a tattoo on my heart
