Holy diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becomin' of me
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean
Gotta get away, holy diver, yeah
Got shiny diamonds
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
Something is coming for you, look out
Race for the morning
You can hide in the sun till you see the light
Oh we will pray it's all right
Gotta get away, get away
Between the velvet lies
There's a truth that's hard as steel, yeah
The vision never diеs
Life's a never еnding wheel
Say, holy diver
You're the star of the masquerade
No need to look so afraid
Jump, jump, jump on the tiger
You can feel his heart but you know he's mean
Some light can never be seen, yeah
Holy diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becomin' of me
No, no, ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean
Gotta get away, get away
Gotta get away, get away, yeah
Holy diver
Soul survivor
You're the one who's clean
Holy diver
Yeah, all right
Holy diver
