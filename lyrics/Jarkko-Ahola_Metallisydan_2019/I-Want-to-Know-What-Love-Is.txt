I've gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older
Now this mountain, I must climb
Feels like the world upon my shoulders
But through the clouds, I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder
In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me (Ooh)
I'm gonna take a littlе time
A little time to look around mе
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me
In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
I can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
(And I wanna feel) I wanna feel what love is
(And I know) I know you can show me
I've gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
