Words like tidal waves will sweep me off my quiet caves and
Drown my fireplace and taunt me while I lie awake
The moon's got a grudge
It's trying to hold me
But my hands won't budge
As I coax 'em out slowly

My words are spurted perfect
I'm a surgeon with a scalpel working 'til I've heard precision
It's inertia and a balance of boredom and annoyance at my past work
I'm scared of it
And all these fucking people see me as my first experiment so
Back on my bullshit like an addict relapsing
I'm Earl how I act like lateral passing
My passion back with it having been tattered and blackened
You feel what I'm saying no matter if it's fact or I'm capping
High school ass like flatulence splattering
Lathering it on the bathroom walls until its plastered in
Last year had me acting like a rat in a lab and
This year found out I was discharging battery acid
Had to throw out my fruit snacks
Get my old groove back
New name, Mr. Bloom only speaks true facts
Maybe
Cause I stay confusing clueless cats
And everybody already fucking knew that

Words like tidal waves will sweep me off my quiet caves and
Drown my fireplace and taunt me while I lie awake
The moon's got a grudge
It's trying to hold me
But my hands won't budge
As I coax 'em out slowly

And I don't get the stress and emphasis on meant to be identity
All my fucking friends were meant as entities and that's the end of it
Concept is elementary like jotting rhetoric into your head correct to fit it in a song, bruh
It's coming up my head erects an S ahead a monka
Slipped through the cracks like ass goalies and hockey pucks
Cath told me
I knew one wave was not enough
Got this shit banging, call it potty fuck
And I don't ride waves, I'm okay with the tide shifts
Leave 'em eyes dazed, wide gaze, hidden eyelids
All these tired days, skies rain, now my grays turned vibrant
No precipitation 'sides flakes from my iced wrist
And fuck approval from the older me I'll soon be older than
I'll sprint ahead of him like mortal rodents in a cobra's den
Slithering and shivering, he know his flow was colder then
So hit me in my DMs if you know who got a coat to lend

Words like tidal waves will sweep me off my quiet caves and
Drown my fireplace and taunt me while I lie awake
The moon's got a grudge
It's trying to hold me
But my hands won't budge
As I coax 'em out slowly
Words like tidal waves will sweep me off my quiet caves and
Drown my fireplace and taunt me while I lie awake
The moon's got a grudge
It's trying to hold me
But my hands won't budge
As I coax 'em out slowly
