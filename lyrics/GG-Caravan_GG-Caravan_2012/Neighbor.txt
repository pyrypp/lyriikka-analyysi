Sittin' in your front yard 
Drinkin' lemonade
Suburban life, a pretty wife
You think you've got it made
But you don't know what's in the store
For you and your family
I'm movin' in, right next door
Won't you welcome me?It's a beautiful day in the neighbourhood
And I hope I didn't ruin your day
Won't you be my neighbour?I brought my life, my ugly wife
My dirty dog with fleas
My kid's a punk, and I'm drunk
But this I'm sure you'll see
Yeah you don't know what it's like
To live in misery
Welcome to home sweet Hell
Dissatisfaction guaranteedIt's a beautiful day in the neighbourhood
And if I could I surely would
Invite you in and say
Won't you be my neighbour?
Won't you be my neighbour?
Won't you be my neighbour?
Won't you be my neighbour?C'mon I don't think you'll find
A place to live in peace of mind
You're gonna live in misery
When you're livin' next to me!It's a beautiful day in the neighbourhood
Raaaah! Won't you be, now
Won't you be my funky neighbour?!Well I drink and I stink
I smoke, I'm a joke!
I try all night and day to get a piece of the action, a--aaa!
And you should know by now you're never gonna forget it
Now I know just what are you're thinkin'
It could be you out 'n' you're drinkin'
So don't you knock it until you try it
It could be you in a little while!
I hope I didn't ruin your day!It's a beautiful day in the neighbourhood
I dig your wife, she sure is good
A beautiful day in the neighbourhood...ha, ha
