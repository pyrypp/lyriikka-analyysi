Oh, teen angel, teen angel
My heart is true
Teen angel, teen angel
Only for you
If you'll be my darling
I promise you I'll never make you cry
Oh, teen angel, teen angel
I can see it in your eyes
Teen angel, teen angel
The true love never dies
You'll always be my darling
I promise you we'll never fall apart
Oh, darling I promise you
You'll never be alone
And I always, I always stand by you
Oh darling will you promise me
I never have to be alone
And you'll always be mine
Oh, teen angel, teen angel
My heart is true
Teen angel, teen angel
Only for you
You'll always be my darling
I promise you we'll never fall apart
