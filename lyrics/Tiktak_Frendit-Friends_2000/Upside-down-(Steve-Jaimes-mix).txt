Upside down and inside out
Upside down and inside out
When - you are feeling so down
Your whole world looks grey
And the rain comes 'round
Then - just like a little white dove
You fly away
There's a rainbow waiting above
Upside down and inside out
Let all of your worries come undone
Upside down and inside out
And soon we'll be dancing in the sun
So - you think you've lost everything
Seems like no one cares
And the birds won't sing
Go - so far above the ground
Soar through the air
You can turn that frown upside down
Upside down and inside out
Let all of your worries come undone
Upside down and inside out
And soon we'll be dancing in the sun
Soon you will see
Everything is so different
From way up in the sky
This is where you can be
So strong and free
While you fly high
Upside down and inside out
Let all of your worries come undone
Upside down and inside out
And soon we'll be dancing in the sun
