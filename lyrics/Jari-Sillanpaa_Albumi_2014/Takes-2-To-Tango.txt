Time to leave, time to feel
Harp and horn, music's born
Two worlds meet
Hungry sharing a fantasy
Tail and wing, soon will swing
Dusk till dawn, let the show just begin
In a place where pardon stand
Giving feast on sacred land

The angels and devils meet at night (Hallelujah!)
They dance, they caress each other holding on so tight
The angels and demons side by side (Hallelujah!)
They dance until morning light
When nobody else is in sight
Takes two to tango, tango

Purified, justified
Times of lust (Times of lust)
Times of trust (Times of trust)
Praising dark
For one moment in paradise
Passion flows, eager grows
Time runs out, it's the end of the show
When the morning is at hand
Time has come to show their stand

The angels and devils meet at night (Hallelujah!)
They dance, they caress each other holding on so tight
The angels and demons side by side (Hallelujah!)
They dance until morning light
When nobody else is in sight
Takes two to tango

Angels falling, hear them calling
Demons rising, they're disguising
Hearts are beating, secret meeting
Just for the moment in love

The angels and devils meet at night (Ha..., ha..., hallelujah!)
They dance, they caress each other holding on so tight
The angels and demons side by side (Ha..., ha..., hallelujah!)
They dance until morning light
When nobody else is in sight
Takes two to tango!
