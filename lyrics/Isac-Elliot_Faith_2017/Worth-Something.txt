The first sign of trouble
The last one to know
Mmm, tell yourself it's nothing, yeah
Just kill me slow

(Oh, oh) Though I know I'm free to go
Can't find the strength, the door is open (Door is open)
Mmm, though I know I'm free to go
Don't wanna break this holy moment (This holy moment)

When the truth is you're still on my mind
Isn't that worth something? Isn't that worth everything?
When you know it's real, it's hard to find
Isn't that worth something? Isn't that worth everything?

Isn't that worth something? Isn't that worth everything?
Isn't that worth something? Isn't that worth everything?

The words too hard to follow
The same old mistakes
Oh, one after another
But I still see your face

Though I know I'm free to go
Can't find the strength, the door is open (Door is open)
Mmm, though I know I'm free to go
Don't wanna break this holy moment (This holy moment)

When the truth is you're still on my mind
Isn't that worth something? Isn't that worth everything?
When you know it's real, it's hard to find
Isn't that worth something? Isn't that worth everything?

Isn't that worth something? Isn't that worth everything?
Isn't that worth something? Isn't that worth everything?

I don't see what you see (Ooh), oh, oh
Isn't that worth something? (Right now)
Ooh, right now, isn't that worth everything? Oh

Isn't that worth something? Isn't that worth everything? (Oh)
Isn't that worth something? (Yeah) Isn't that worth everything?
Isn't that worth something? Isn't that worth everything?
(Oh-oh) Isn't that worth something? Isn't that worth everything?
Oh-oh
