You made a mess and now my heart is an open wound, oh no
How do we save something there's nothing left to lose? Oh
And when you're there, don't care, I know it just ain't right
I told myself from the start that I don't need you

But then I fall back under
I get that feeling, back to that summer
No matter what it is, you keep me falling under
I get that feeling, feeling for your love
But when I'm alone I know

I, I, I can't see myself with no one else
Can't see myself with no one but you
I, I, I can't see myself with no one else, yeah
Can't see myself with no one but you

Round and round we go
Round and round in circles
It's a never ending road
But when I'm alone I know
I, I, I can't see myself with no one else
Can't see myself with no one but you

I spend my days just repeating the same old scene, uhm yeah
Watch your light slip away, if it ain't with me, no

But then I fall back under
I get that feeling, back to that summer
No matter what it is, you keep me falling under
I get that feeling, feeling for your love
But when I'm alone I know

I, I, I can't see myself with no one else
Can't see myself with no one but you
I, I, I can't see myself with no one else, yeah
Can't see myself with no one but you

Round and round we go
Round and round in circles
It's a never ending road
But when I'm alone I know
I, I, I can't see myself with no one else
Can't see myself with no one but you

But then I fall back under
I get that feeling, back to that summer
No matter what it is, you keep me falling under
I get that feeling, feeling for your love
But when I'm alone

I, I, I can't see myself with no one else
Can't see myself with no one but you (No one else but you)
I, I, I can't see myself with no one else (See myself)
Can't see myself with no one but you

Round and round we go
Round and round in circles
It's a never ending road (Never ending road)
But when I'm alone I know
I, I, I can't see myself with no one else (I can't see)
(No) can't see myself with no one but you
