You ain't no liar
Is he the one?
Does he make you feel special?
Are you in denial?
When he's all over
And he's long gone
I'll be your protection
You won't have to question

No, I'm not tryin' to fix all the mistakes that he made before, oh
So, you just need to take a leap of faith, 'cause I'll be more

I'll feel my way through this with my eyes shut
I'll touch all the places you never knew
Baby, let me do this with my eyes shut
Tell me what you needin' my hands to do

Do what you want me to, oh
Do what you want me to, oh
Do what you want me to, hey
Do what you want me to, oh

Try not to wave her
But I see your heart
He stops you from beating
So I want you to leave him
Do yourself a favor
And walk out the door
You need the exposure
Let me be the closure

No, I'm not tryin' to fix all the mistakes that he made before, oh
So, you just need to take a leap of faith, 'cause I'll be more

I'll feel my way through this with my eyes shut
I'll touch all the places you never knew
Baby, let me do this with my eyes shut
Tell me what you needin' my hands to do

Do what you want me to, oh
Do what you want me to, oh
With my eyes shut, hey
Do what you want me to, oh

And when it's all over
All over, all over, all over
And he's long gone
I'll be your protection
You won't have to question
You won't have to question

I'll feel my way through this with my eyes shut
I'll touch all the places you never knew
Baby, let me do this with my eyes shut
Tell me what you needin' my hands to do

Do what you want me to, oh
Do what you want me to, oh
With my eyes shut, hey
Do what you want me to
(With my eyes shut), oh
With my eyes shut
