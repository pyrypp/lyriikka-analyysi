I know you're thinking
That I'm right here where you left me
Patiently waiting for your call
Never imagined
That I'd ever tell you, "no"
'Cause it's never happened before

If you'd thought higher of yourself
You'd be up in the clouds
But here, let me help you down
So, don't tell me that you
Wanna start working it out
When it's too late to question now

What about me?
What about what I want?
Wanna know what I think?
No, I didn't think so I
I feel like I played the fool
In assuming that life ain't all about you
Yeah

You think I'm crazy
For not wanting you no more
But how can you blame me? (Blame me, yeah)
When you're (When you're)
So self-righteous
In a perfume of politeness, oh
Yes, your highness (Oh)

If you'd thought higher of yourself
You'd be up in the clouds
But here, let me help you down
So, don't tell me that you
Wanna start working it out
When it's too late to question now

What about me?
What about what I want?
Wanna know what I think?
No, I didn't think so I
I feel like I played the fool
In assuming that life ain't all about you

Oh oh, 'cause it's all about you
Yeah, it's all about you
All about you
It's all about you
It's all about you-ou
It's all about you
It's all about you-ou
It's all about you
It's all about you-ou
It's all about you
(It's all about you-ou)

What about me?
What about what I want?
Wanna know what I think?
No, I didn't think so I
I feel like I played the fool
In assuming that life (Oh-oh-oh-oh) ain't all about you

It's all about you
It's all about you-ou (Oh)
It's all about you (Yeah)
It's all about you-ou
It's all about you
It's all about you-ou (Oh)
It's all about you
All about you
