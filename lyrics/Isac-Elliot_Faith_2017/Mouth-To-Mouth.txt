Your lips are moving, but I don't hear a thing
Your body calling, call it biology
I'm on a mission, so breathe in all on me
Breathe in all on me, baby

And I'm good at conversations
But I'm down with using words
Let's give into the temptation
'Cause I got you here to learn, yeah

Mouth to mouth, mouth to mouth
I can give you mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth, mouth to mouth
You can teach me all about
Mouth to mouth, mouth to mouth
I can give you mouth to mouth

You want it
I want it
(Yeah)

I'm sick of distance, remove the space between
It's human nature, it's only natural
So let me take you, somewhere you've never been
Somewhere you've never been (Oh)

And I'm good at conversations
But I'm down with using words (No)
Let's give into the temptation (Yeah)
'Cause I got you here to learn (Learn)

Mouth to mouth, mouth to mouth
I can give you mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth, mouth to mouth
You can teach me all about
Mouth to mouth, mouth to mouth
I can give you mouth to mouth

You want it
I want it (Oh-oh)
You want it
I want it (Oh)
You want it

You can bring me back back, back, back, back, back
You can bring me back back, back
You can bring me back back, back, back, back, back
You can bring me back back, back

Mouth to mouth, mouth to mouth
I can give you mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth, mouth to mouth
You can teach me all about
Mouth to mouth, mouth to mouth
I can give you mouth to mouth

You want it
(Mouth to mouth I  can give you)

Mouth to mouth, mouth to mouth
I can give you mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth, mouth to mouth
You can teach me all about
Mouth to mouth, mouth to mouth
I can give you mouth to mouth

You want it
I want it
(Bring me back, oh)
You want it
I want it (oh)
You want it
I want it
