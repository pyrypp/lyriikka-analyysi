I know she don't got the best reputation
There's something about her, she ain't got nothing to prove
She walk in here without no invitation
And I'm right behind her 'cause I got nothing to lose

She say what she wanna
Wear what she wanna
Be what she wanna
Do what she wanna do
Right when she wanna
Come when she wanna
She gonna blow me away

Ayo, she came out just to play, yo
Not gonna get in the way, yo
Ain't gonna make her stop
Ayo, she know just what to say, yo
I just can't stay away, yo
Ain't gonna make her stop

Ayo
Ayo
Ain't gonna make her stop
Ayo
Ayo
Ayo, ayo

Anything she want, she know she can take it
I'm getting wrapped up in all of that attitude (Attitude)
If she a mistake then I guess I'mma make it (I'mma make it)
I hate that I love it, I can't rise above it
I'm so confused (Yeah)

She say what she wanna
Wear what she wanna
Be what she wanna
Do what she wanna do
Right when she wanna
Come when she wanna
She gonna blow me away

Ayo, she came out just to play, yo
Not gonna get in the way, yo
Ain't gonna make her stop (Uh-huh, yeah)
Ayo, she know just what to say, yo
