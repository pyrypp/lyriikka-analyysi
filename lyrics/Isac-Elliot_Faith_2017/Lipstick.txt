Remember, you had me falling for you like it's September
You know I've been all over girl, but I never
Had seen somebody do the things that you do-o-o-o-o
Do-o-o-o-o
So help me, the way I think about you, you know it ain't healthy
I can't erase the mark you made, when you left me
And now you're stuck on me just like a tattoo-o-o-o-o
You-o-o-o-o

One step closer
Anywhere you go, I'll follow baby
Can't get over
Every time I close my eyes I see your

Lipstick, I can't believe that's all she left me with
She stole my heart and then she ran with it
Leaving me nothing but that last kiss
And a little bit of lipstick
Right now, you're probably halfway to another town
If you can hear me baby, turn around
And give me more than just another kiss
And a little bit of lipstick

Lately, you're taking up the spotlight in my day dreams
I'm tryna keep it cool, but I keep failing
And anything I do reminds me of you-o-o-o-o
You-o-o-o-o

One step closer
Anywhere you go, I'll follow baby
Can't get over
Every time I close my eyes I see your

Lipstick, I can't believe that's all she left me with
She stole my heart and then she ran with it
Leaving me nothing but that last kiss
And a little bit of lipstick
Right now, you're probably halfway to another town
If you can hear me, baby, turn around
And give me more than just another kiss
And a little bit of lipstick

Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Come back, I'm ready for you
Come back, I want you
Come back, I'm ready for you
Come back, I want you

Yeah, it makes your lipstick that's really rude
Your mom, your friends, they believe me too
I need you, but you need me too
You know I got that sauce for your bbq
Yeah, I got that sauce, got the sauce on 'em
Every time I eat I gotta floss on 'em
Singing on the head, I gotta talk on it
Hardwood floors, baby girl we could ball on them
Saying I record too much, should love this song
And I don't talk when you in the club all night, no
Do your thang, it does me no harm
Just gimme your love baby, we alright

Lipstick, (Yeah we're good) I can't believe that's all she left me with
She stole my heart and then she ran with it (Tyga)
Leaving me nothing but that last kiss
And a little bit of lipstick
Right now, you're probably halfway to another town
(To another town)
If you can hear me baby, turn around (Turn around)
And give me more than just another kiss
And a little bit of lipstick

Oh (Just a little bit, just a little bit of lipstick)
Come back, I'm ready for you
Come back, I want you
Come back, I'm ready for you
Come back, I want you
