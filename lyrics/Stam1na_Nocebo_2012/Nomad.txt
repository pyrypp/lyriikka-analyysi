North against South
Between magnetic fields
In bipolar disorder is a figurine misplaced
I am Faithless, I am No-One
With no soul belonging nowhere
I'm just longing to stay right here
I am Atheist
I am None

The world seems like an overflowing hour glass
With nothing to drink from but the sand of time

Beyond all fear
Beyond all fear
Nomad on no man's land
Nomad on no man's land

Everywhere it's the same old song
(Kaikkialla soi sama virsi)
Is there a cure for this disease
(Onko l채채kett채 tuohon tautiin)
The answer is clear
(Vastaus on ilmiselv채)
Time is the antibiodic of death
(Aika on kuoleman antibiootti)

Beyond all fear
Beyond all fear
Nomad on no man's land
Nomad on no man's land

Me against myself
Between magnetic fields
In bipolar disorder
I'm a figurine misplaced
