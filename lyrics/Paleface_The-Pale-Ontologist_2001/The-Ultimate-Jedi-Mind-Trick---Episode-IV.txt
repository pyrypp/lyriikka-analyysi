Fear is the path to the Dark side
Fear is the path to the Dark side
(I wanna be your Jedi Knight)
Y'all answer the Empire's call loyal like Darth Maul
Then fall out, stall out like an amphetamine user
'cos a beggar can't be a chooser
'cos youse a loser, like an Indiana Hoosier
Facin' charges of being a wife abuser, wife beater, wife batterer, wife bruiser
Straight pathetic like an Imperial cruiser
Goin' against two Rebel Alliance X-wing fighters
I got the touch of Midas, y'all go ahead and dig out
Your lighters and wave 'em fuckers around like exciters
Callin' all you graffiti writers, rap reciters, I call on the Force to guide us
As a team like Kobe, I'm hiphop's last hope like Obi-Wan Kenobi
Fear is the path to the Dark side
Fear is the path to the Dark side
(I wanna be your Jedi Knight)
Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads
To suffering (and ask Yoda)
Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads
To suffering
I go: "Do not underestimate the power of the Dark side!"
Just like James Earl Jones, I got the skellies in the closet they'll
Be rattlin' their bones like Emperor Palpatine
He's got the transsubstantiation with the bread and the wine
Whine, heavy, mechanized breathing like Darth Vader
It's like you made a sound 'even the tiniest
It's see you later!
He'll decapitate your head with a lightsaber
But when it comes to sentences
Capital punishment is better than life - with hard labour
Ask your neighbour, he'll tell you that a...

Fear is the path to the Dark side
(I wanna be your Jedi Knight)
Fear is the path to the Dark side
(I wanna be your Jedi Knight)
Play Sabacc, my deck is set, my dice is loaded
My rhyme is often scrambled, encrypted and coded
Like R2D2 or Morse, I'm showin' no remorse
Unmovable like a statue of a war hero mounted on a horse
I play the Force like a game of polo
Still lookin' for my Princess Leia like Han Solo
I happen to know the mayor to the Cloud City
Mr. Calrissian, Lando backstabbin' KC like Evan Dando
My rhymes is fat like motherfuckin' Marlon Brando
I possess magic like Orlando, I hunt heads for props
And not for bounty like Boba Fett
It's six in the morning I'm not sober yet!
You weak, a-triflin', straight feeble
No talent whatsoever like Sy Snootles with the band of Max Rebo
Entertaining the scum of the universe and Jabba
You know it shows, you into crystal meth 'cos you blabber
And talk and talk faster, and even faster, you lose all your power
Like the blasters on the Millennium Falcon
At the crucial moment, you was supposed to jump into hyperspace
Keep snortin' that shit and they'll diagnose you as a
Diaper case
Fear is the path to the Dark side
Fear is the path to the Dark side
(I wanna be your Jedi Knight)
Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads
To suffering (and ask Yoda)
Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads
To suffering
