Something 'bout you girl, something makes you so good
Something 'bout you girl, something messin' me, messin' me up
You hit me like, "Here's a fever for you
You can't sweat out and you just can't cool"

I think you know you got style, alright, alright, alright
I think you know you're so fine, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're one of a kind, beautiful all the time
Girl, you're one of a kind, yeah, yeah

When you walk in all people stop and stare
When you walk in they whisper, "Look at her"
How do you do the things you do?
How do you do so that when you walk in the room
All the guys go (*whistling*)
Even the girls go (*whistling*)

It's like the whole world's
All crazy 'bout you girl, all crazy 'bout you, girl
So crazy 'bout you, girl
And it's like your beauty makes me hush

Nothing compares to your eyes, nothing you do, girl
Nothing's making me anything but wild
You spin me 'round, I'm a sucker for you
I'm feeling down 'cause I know it's true

I think you know you got style, alright, alright, alright
I think you know you're so fine, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're one of a kind, beautiful all the time
Girl, you're one of a kind, yeah, yeah

When you walk in all people stop and stare
When you walk in they whisper, "Look at her"
How do you do the things you do?
How do you do so that when you walk in the room
All the guys go (*whistling*)
Even the girls go (*whistling*)

It's like the whole world's
All crazy 'bout you girl, all crazy 'bout you, girl
So crazy 'bout you, girl
And it's like your beauty makes me hush

Supergirl, you're so fantastic
Extramadelicious
Yeah, you're so, yeah, you're so
Yeah, you're so gorgeous

When you walk in all people stop and stare (Whoa-oh)
When you walk in they whisper, "Look at her"
How do you do the things you do?
How do you do so that when you walk in the room
All the guys go (*whistling*) (All the guys go, yeah)
Even the girls go (*whistling*) (Even the girls go, even the girls go,  all the girls go)
All the guys go (*whistling*) (Yeah, yeah, even the girls go, oh-whoa)
