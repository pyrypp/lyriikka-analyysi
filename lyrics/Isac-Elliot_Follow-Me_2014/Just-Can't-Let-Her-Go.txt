I've been hypnotized
By bright red candy lips
And angel eyes
I know that it ain't right
Her pretty comes with pain
My hands are tied

(Oh) I want her, everybody wants her, she knows it, eh, eh, eh
I want her but I better run away, 'cause I know-oh-oh

She's so mean but I kinda love it and I just can't let her go
I'm so whipped, she deserves a medal, she's a tempting animal
Spends too much and I never tell her, "no"
Drives me nuts and she got me by the throat
She's so mean but I kinda love it and I just can't let her go

La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la and I just can't let her go
La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la and I just can't let her go

Breaks a billion hearts
I know I'm next in line
But I don't mind

(Oh) I want her, everybody wants her, she knows it, eh, eh, eh
I want her but I better run away, 'cause I know-oh-oh

She's so mean but I kinda love it and I just can't let her go
I'm so whipped, she deserves a medal, she's a tempting animal (Yeah-yeah)
Spends too much and I never tell her, "no"
Drives me nuts and she got me by the throat
She's so mean but I kinda love it and I just can't let her go

La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la and I just can't let her go
La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la and I just can't let her go

Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one last time
Just one last time

She's so mean but I kinda love it and I just can't let her go (Yeah-yeah)
I'm so whipped, she deserves a medal, she's a tempting animal (Oh)
Spends too much and I never tell her, "no" (Oh)
Drives me nuts and she got me by the throat
She's so mean but I kinda love it and I just can't let her go

La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la (I just can't let her go)
La-la-la and I just can't let her go
La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la (I just can't let her go, come on)
La-la-la and I just can't let her go
