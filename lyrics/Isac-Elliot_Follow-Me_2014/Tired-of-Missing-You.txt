Walked away, walked away
With a piece of mind (Mind), with a piece of mind (Mind)
Like that other time
Ran away, ran away
Didn't even cry (Cry), didn't even cry (Cry)
Baby, not this time

This loss of merry that goes down
I'm tired of sticking around and playing one of your games
This love was crushed into the ground
So now I put out the flame

I just want you to know, know, know
I'm tired of missing you
I gotta let go, go, go
I'm tired of missing you
So baby I'm saying: "Bye, bye
Made up my mind
Girl, that was the last time"
I want you to know, know, know, know, know, know...

Like the sun, like the sun
Yeah, you made it shine, yeah, you made it shine
No, I can't deny
Like the rain, like the rain
Made it black and white, made it black and white (Yeah)
Feeling grey inside

This loss of merry that goes down
I'm tired of sticking around and playing one of your games
This love was crushed into the ground
So now I put out the flame

I just want you to know, know, know
I'm tired of missing you
I gotta let go, go, go
I'm tired of missing you
So baby I'm saying: "Bye, bye
Made up my mind
Girl, that was the last time"
I want you to know, know, know, know, know, know...

I just want you to know

Walked away, walked away
With a piece of mind, with a piece of mind
Like that other time, time, time....

I just want you to know, know, know
I'm tired of missing you
I gotta let go, go, go
I'm tired of missing you
So baby I'm saying: "Bye, bye
Made up my mind
Girl, that was the last time"
I gotta let go, go, go (I gotta let you go, I gotta let go)
I'm tired of missing you

I just want you to know
I just want you to know
