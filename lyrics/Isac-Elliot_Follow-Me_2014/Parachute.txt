Mmm, yeah

I know you've been scared, let me hold you
Girl, lay right there, close to me
I'll take you from here, trust me, baby
From the storm, I'll steer, hold on to me

When all the light's gone
I'll be, I'll be fighting for you and me
And all the hope's gone
You'll see I'll be there

When you're fallin', you know I'll be there for you
Just take my hand, hold on I'll be there
I'll be your parachute, falling down, down, down
I'll be your parachute, before you fall down, down, I'll catch you

(Mmm) So cold up here (Yeah, hey), let me warm you
No need to fear (Need to fear), just fly with me

When all the light's gone (Light is gone)
I'll be (I'll be), I'll be fighting for you and me
And all the hope's gone
You'll see I'll be there

When you're fallin', you know I'll be there for you
Just take my hand, hold on I'll be there
I'll be your parachute, falling down, down, down
I'll be your parachute, before you fall down, down, I'll catch you

When the rain falls down, yeah
When the rain falls down, I'll catch you
When the rain falls down
Under my parachute, ooh-ooh, oh
Baby girl, don't you know that

When you're fallin' down, oh, you know I'll be there for you
Just take my hand (Just take my hand), you know I'll be
You know I'll be your parachute, falling down, down, down
I'll be your parachute, before you fall down, down, I'll catch you
