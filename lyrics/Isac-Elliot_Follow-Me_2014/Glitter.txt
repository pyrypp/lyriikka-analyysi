Woah-oh

So beautiful
Got me wrapped around her finger
She's mystical
She's the magic, I'm the wizard

She's so sweet, I must be dreaming
It's unreal, the way she's glowing
Don't you know?
Baby, you're a stunner

It's amazing how you glitter, glitter, glitter so bright
Just like in a movie, what you doing to me
Girl, you glitter, glitter, glitter, alright
And when you're smiling, my heart is dancing, oh

Woah-oh, woah-oh (Glitter)
Woah-oh, woah-oh

So natural
You don't need no makeup
It's incredible
You're so good you could be made up

She's so sweet, I must be dreaming
Oh my god, I think I'm dying
Don't you know?
Baby, you're a stunner

It's amazing how you glitter, glitter, glitter so bright (Oh, babe)
Just like in a movie, what you doing to me
Girl, you glitter, glitter, glitter, alright
And when you're smiling, my heart is dancing, oh (Dancing)

Woah-oh, woah-oh (Glitter)
Woah-oh, woah-oh (Glitter)
Woah-oh, woah-oh (Glitter)
(Oh)

I'll buy you all the shining pearls
You're my diamond girl
I'll fight for you 'til I fall
And when you're walking in
Yeah, you're sparkling
Just like a disco ball

It's amazing how you glitter, glitter, glitter so bright
Just like in a movie (Oh yeah), what you doing to me
(Yeah) Girl, you glitter, glitter, glitter, alright
And when you're smiling, my heart is dancing, oh
How you glitter, glitter, glitter so bright
Just like in a movie, what you doing to me
Girl, you glitter, glitter, glitter, alright
And when you're smiling, my heart is dancing (My heart is dancing), oh

Woah-oh, woah-oh (Glitter)
Woah-oh, woah-oh (Glitter)
Woah-oh, woah-oh (Glitter)
Woah-oh, woah-oh (Glitter)
