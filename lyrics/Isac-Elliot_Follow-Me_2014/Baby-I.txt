Baby I (Baby I, baby I)
Woah-oh, woah-oh
Baby I (Baby I, baby I)
Woah-oh, woah-oh

I can't help losing faith when you say
That you love me so much as a friend
You don't know how it hurts to pretend
When I see you make the same mistakes all over again

Baby, I-I-I-I-I
I would lie-ie-ie-ie-ie
If I told you you'd be better off with someone else

Baby, I-I-I-I-I
I would lie-ie-ie-ie-ie
If I said I never miss you when I'm by myself
So tonight, I will try
I will open up your eyes
'Cause I know that you'd be better off with me instead

Friday night, dressing up to go out
You turn around asking me if you look alright
What can I say? (What can I say?) You blow me away (You blow me away), I wish you were mine (I wish you were mine)
Maybe you already found your Mr. Right, oh

Baby, I-I-I-I-I
I would lie-ie-ie-ie-ie
If I said I never miss you when I'm by myself
So tonight, I will try
I will open up your eyes (Open up your eyes)
'Cause I know that you'd be better off with me instead

So here I am without my armor
You can stab me if you want to
But I won't hold it back no more, no, no, no, no
The truth is that I have always loved you
I'd be a liar if I didn't tell you, oh

Baby, I-I-I-I-I (Baby, I-I-I-I-I)
I would lie-ie-ie-ie-ie (I would lie-ie-ie-ie-ie)
Baby, I
I would lie
If I said I never miss you when I'm by, when I'm by myself
So tonight, I will try
I will open up your eyes (Open up your eyes)
'Cause I know that you'd be better off with me instead

Ooh, baby I (Baby I, I would lie)
I would lie (I would lie-ie-ie-ie)
'Cause I know that you'd be better off with me instead
Baby I (Baby I, baby I)
Woah-oh, woah-oh
