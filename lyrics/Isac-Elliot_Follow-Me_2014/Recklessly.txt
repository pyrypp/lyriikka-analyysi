Recklessly

Oh girl, it should be me who would take you out
Show you places you always dreamt about
We can run away from here right now
Right now, right now, right now (Recklessly)
Oh girl, it should be me who would make you smile
Lift you up if you ever fell down, if I'll be with you
Somehow, somehow, somehow

You don't know what love is before you've had it all

We can be foolhardy
Leave the world behind and go grazy
Wild and free recklessly
I'll make you feel like you're the one for me
My heart goes boom, boom, boom
When I'm with you, you, you
Don't you see were meant to be
Live on full attack and recklessly, oh, oh yeah

Oh girl, it should be me who would love you right
Bring the stars to your sky in the midnight
We would laugh, we would cry, we would feel alive
Alive, alive, alive
So now there we are in this real world
Take the lead and become my girl
'Cause now we both know
It's time, it's time, it's time

You don't know what love is before you've had it all

We can be foolhardy
Leave the world behind and go crazy (Crazy, yeah)
Wild and free recklessly
I'll make you feel like you're the one for me
My heart goes boom, boom, boom
When I'm with you, you, you
Don't you see we're meant to be
Live on full attack and recklessly, oh

Recklessly, oh
Recklessly, oh, oh, oh

I don't know if you're the kind of girl
I don't know if you're the kind of girl
Who could jump head first into this wild, wild, wild, wild world
But I'm thinking you're
I'm thinking that you're everything
I wanted so just stay on my, my, my, my world
And trust me when I say that you're
The only one that I'm so crazy for

My heart goes boom, boom, boom
When I'm with you, you, you
Don't you see we're meant to be
Live on full attack and recklessly, oh, hey

Recklessly, oh
Recklessly, oh
Recklessly (Go recklessly baby, go recklessly)
Recklessly (Go recklessly baby, go recklessly)
Yeah (Go recklessly baby, go recklessly)
Recklessly, oh (Go recklessly baby, go recklessly)
Recklessly
