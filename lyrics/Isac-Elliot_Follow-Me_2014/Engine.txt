Oh my god
You got your head in the clouds, never come down
I love that you're a crazy ride
The way you let down your hair like you don't care

You rock this steady world
Your mine, one of a kind
I guess that opposites they attract
My Jordan's they could run
For miles to see your smile
And, girl, you got me going so fast

'Cause oh, oh my god
Girl, I love this crazy life
And it's you, yeah, it's you
You keep my engine runnin'
And oh, all those nights
You and me what a crazy ride
And it's you, yeah, it's you
You keep my engine runnin'

You keep my engine runnin'

Oh my god
This girl is all that I see, now listen to me
Oh yeah, you got it, that's so hot
The way you dance on the street, you take the lead

You rock this steady world
Your mine one of a kind
I guess that opposites they attract
My Jordan's they could run
For miles to see your smile
And girl you got me going so fast

'Cause oh, oh my god
Girl, I love this crazy life
And it's you, yeah, it's you
You keep my engine runnin'
And oh, all those nights
You and me what a crazy ride
And it's you, yeah, it's you
You keep my engine runnin'

You keep my engine runnin'

You know with you I don't, I don't need no one else
It's incredible, unstoppable (Unstoppable)
And you know me like I know, I know myself
It's magical, don't you know that?
I will do, do, do, do anything
We can love, love, love like we've never been hurt
Like we've never loved before, yeah

You keep my engine runnin' (Engine runnin')
You keep my engine runnin'
You keep my engine runnin'

I know you've got it, I know you've got it, yeah
You've got me going so fast
You keep my engine runnin' (Runnin', runnin', runnin')
