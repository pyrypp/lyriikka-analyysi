My mama said, "Please, call your friends
Because your friends, they think you're dead"
I get, get up and wash my hair
Take out the trash, be self-aware, but I don’t care

I don't even wanna leave my house
No, I don't wanna go out, I wanna stay in bed
I don’t wanna talk about it
Thanks, I'm good
Just wanna be by myself, nobody else
'Cause all I wanna do
Is rest in beat
That's how I find my peace

I wanna rest in beat
That's how I find my peace
I wanna, I wanna rest in beat
Yeah, that's all I need

I could try some therapy
Exercise, eat gluten-free, but I don't care

I don't even wanna leave my house
No, I don’t wanna go out, I wanna stay in bed
I don’t wanna talk about it
Thanks, I'm good
Just wanna be by myself, nobody else
That’s all I wanna do

I wanna rest in beat
That's how I find my peace
I wanna, I wanna rest in beat
Yeah, that's all I need
You know that's how I find my peace

All I wanna
All, all I wanna do
All I wanna do is
Rest in beat
All I wanna
All, all I wanna do
All I wanna do is
Rest in beat

I wanna rest in beat
That’s how I find my peace
I wanna, I wanna rest in beat (I wanna rest in beat)
Yeah, that's all I need (Ooh, ooh)
You know that's how I find my peace

All I wanna (All I wanna)
All, all I wanna do (All I wanna do)
All I wanna do
Is rest in beat
