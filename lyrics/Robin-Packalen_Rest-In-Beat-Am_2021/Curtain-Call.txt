You're callin', I'm fallin' back into your bed
I know that it's over, don't want you back
But the way you show up uninvited
Lookin' like you do, baby
I'm fallin' back into you
I woke up, we act like it never happened
We keep on repeatin', "Never again"
But the way you show up uninvited
Lookin' like you do, baby
I'm fallin' back into you, so

Kiss me, show me that it's all over
I'll make it easy for ya
Put your hands on me right now, rewrite the story
And write it all over my body
What are we waitin' for?
It's our one last curtain call
Kiss me, end it like you mean it, baby
Don't stop 'til I believe in
Put your hands on me right now, rewrite the story
And write it all over my body
What are we waitin' for?
It's our one last curtain call

I made my decision, tryna erase you
Just like an addiction you pull me back
'Cause the way you show up uninvited
Lookin' like you do, baby
I'm fallin' back into you (I'm fallin' back into you), so

Kiss me, show me that it's all over
I'll make it easy for you
Put your hands on me right now, rewrite the story
And write it all over my body
What are we waitin' for?
It's our one last curtain call
Kiss me, end it like you mean it, baby
Don't stop 'til I believe in
Put your hands on me right now, rewrite the story
And write it all over my body
What are we waitin' for?
It's our one last curtain

I pull you in, you push me out
It don't mean nothin', nothin' now we're done
You pull me in, I push you out
And we'll regret it in the morning, but girl, before we know it
You're callin' and I fall into your bed

Kiss me, show me that it's all over
I'll make it easy for you
Put your hands on me right now, rewrite the story
And write it all over my body
What are we waitin' for?
It's our one last curtain call
Kiss me, end it like you mean it, babe
Don't stop 'til I believe in
Put your hands on me right now, rewrite the story
And write it all over my body
What are we waitin' for?
It's our one last curtain call

Our call, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
