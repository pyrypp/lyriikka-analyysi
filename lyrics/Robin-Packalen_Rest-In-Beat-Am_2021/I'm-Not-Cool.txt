I'm not cool
And I don't how to fake it
All I know is I like you
I don't know how else to say it

I'm not the one to think before I talk, I know
I know I always make someone uncomfortable
But nothing I can do about it, I'm not cool
So I'm just gonna say this

I'm sorry if I'm talking way too much
And I probably already messed it up
But I'm not sorry to be close to you right now
(Ooh-ooh, I'm not cool)
Am I causing a scene and ruining everything?
In front of everyone, your friends and family
But we can laugh about it on our way back home
(Ooh-ooh, I'm not cool)

But I like you
Tell me if I'm being crazy
When I'm with you I don't mind
What everyone is saying

I'm not the one to think before I talk, I know
I know I always make someone uncomfortable
But nothing I can do about it, I'm not cool
And I don't how to fake it

I'm sorry if I'm talking way too much
And I probably already messed it up
But I'm not sorry to be close to you right now
(Ooh-ooh, I'm not cool)
Am I causing a scene and ruining everything?
In front of everyone, your friends and family
But we can laugh about it on our way back home
(Ooh-ooh, I'm not cool)

Tell me something
I don't wanna ask you if you liked me
But do you like me?
I'm so sorry
Didn't mean to ask you if you like me
But do you like me?

I'm sorry if I'm talking way too much
And I probably already messed it up
But I'm not sorry to be close to you right now
(Ooh-ooh, I'm not cool)
Am I causing a scene and ruining everything?
In front of everyone, your friends and family
But we can laugh about it on our way back home
(Ooh-ooh, I'm not cool)

But I like you
