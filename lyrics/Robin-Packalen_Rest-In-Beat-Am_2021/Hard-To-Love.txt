Used to be cautious
Keep my heart up in my sleeve when my door's open
To not get broken
Had all the options
I kept chasing empty feels coming and going
Just floating

Now every step you take in my direction
Makes me change my ways
Every move you make, it's pure perfection
Perfection

I know I'm hard to love
But you make it easy
When you put your lips
And your hands on my heart
I know I'm hard to love
But you make me need it
Never thought I'd let you
As close as we are
'Cause I know I'm hard to—

How do you do it?
Go and brеak down all my walls with just a glance it's
Like magic
I'm not used to it (I'm not usеd to it)
Scared of heights 'cause if I fall it might be tragic
No, no, no

Now every step you take in my direction
Makes me change my ways
Every move you make, it's pure perfection
Perfection

I know I'm hard to love
But you make it easy
When you put your lips
And your hands on my heart
I know I'm hard to love
But you make me need it
Never thought I'd let you
As close as we are
'Cause I know I'm hard to love, love
'Cause I know I'm hard to love, love

'Cause I know I'm hard to love
'Cause I know I'm hard to love, mhm
Every move you make it's pure perfection, perfection
I know I'm hard to love
(I'm hard to) Love
(I'm hard to) 'Cause I know I'm hard to love
(I'm hard to) Love

I know I'm hard to love
But you make it easy
When you put your lips (I'm hard to)
And your hands on my heart
I know I'm hard to love
But you make me need it (Make me need it)
Never thought I'd let you
As close as we are
'Cause I know I'm hard to love
