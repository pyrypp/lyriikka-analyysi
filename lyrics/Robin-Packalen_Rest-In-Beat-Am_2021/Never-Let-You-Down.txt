Are you coming for the night, she moans
You could be the one I want
Let me give you all my lust
She can play me every time if she wants, yeah
'Cause I'm addicted to her love
I need more at every cost

Ooh, I know she's gone to faking, I know she is, oh no
Ooh, damn it feels amazing, oh yeah

You can take my heart and break it
When you do, it will be forgiven
I'ma try to get off my addiction
I am looking for love, girl
You ain't looking for love, girl
Still, I never let you down
Ooh (Still, I never let you down)
Ooh

Can you takе us on a ride, down low
So I can go back to a place
Wherе I know that we are safe
I don't wanna really fight my hopes
'Cause I'm not ready to go on
Wanna stay where we belong

Ooh, you know you drive me crazy, you know you do, oh-woah
Ooh, I can't even explain it, oh-ooh

You can take my heart and break it
When you do, it will be forgiven
I'ma try to get off my addiction
I am looking for love, girl
You ain't looking for love, girl
Still, I never let you down
Ooh (Still, I never let you down)
Ooh (Still, I never let you down)
Ooh (Still, I never let you down)
Ooh (Still, I never let you down)

When the night comes you will hit the road
Red light make your eyes shine even more
That's when I knew I lost all control
We're all looking for love, girl
You ain't looking for love, girl

You can take my heart and break it
When you do, it will be forgiven
I'ma try to get off my addiction
I am looking for love, girl
You ain't looking for love, girl
Still, I never let you down
Ooh (Still, I never let you down)
Ooh (Still, I never let you down)
Ooh (Still, I never let you down)
