You're calling me up
In the middle of the night
Asking for love
And if you can come inside
I already know just how it'll go
If I open up the door
Oh no, yeah

I know you're gonna let your body do all the talking
Until you get me right where you want
Baby, if I let you in, I know I'll be falling
And I'm just gonna sit back and watch

How you love me like an angel
My heart between your teeth
Oh, you got my attention
'Cause I'm a sucker for that
Love me like an angel
Now you got what you need
I'm dancing on your heartbeat
I'm a sucker for that love (Hm)
I'm a sucker for that love

You're calling me up
Just thе way you've done beforе
Asking for love
But only when you're bored
I already know just how it'll go
When I open up the door
Oh no, oh no, oh no

I know you're gonna let your body do all the talking
Until you get me right where you want
Baby, if I let you in, I know I'll be falling
And I'm just gonna sit back and watch

How you love me like an angel
My heart between your teeth
Oh, you got my attention
'Cause I'm a sucker for that
Love me like an angel
Now you got what you need
I'm dancing on your heartbeat
I'm a sucker for that love (For that love)

Come and break my heart
You know I'll never get enough
Boy, you got my body so addicted to your touch
So come and break my heart
And show me how, baby, how, yeah

Oh, you love me like an angel (Like an angel)
My heart between your teeth (Yeah)
