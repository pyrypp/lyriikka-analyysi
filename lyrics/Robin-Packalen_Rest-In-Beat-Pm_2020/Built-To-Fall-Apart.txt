I won't lie you and I we are like straight up cyanide
And I don’t know what I'm fighting for
Can't take it no more
But when you’re there in my bed
It's so easy to forget about the setbacks and warning signs
No red flags I'm colorblind oh
I bring out the worst in you
You bring out the worst in me
There's nothing we can do
Babe we're built to fall apart
I can't believe we ever got this far
But I'm a fool for your love
Babe we're built to fall apart
Oh we’ve been bleeding out right from the start
But I’m a fool for your love
I'm not ashamed, I’m insane I lovе the way you love and hate
I brеathe you until I suffocate
I'm running from it if I'm honest always knew that I will loose it
I don't mind though I will fight I will love you till I die
Babe we’re built to fall apart
I can't believe we ever got this far
But I'm a fool for your love
Babe we're built to fall apart
Oh we've been bleeding out right from the start
But I'm a fool for your love
Babe we're built to fall apart
And I can't believe we ever got this far
But I'm a fool for your love
Babe we're built to fall apart
Oh we've been bleeding out right from the start
But I'm a fool for your love
