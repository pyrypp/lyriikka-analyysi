She is just a girl she used to know
Driving down the highway along the coast
It's the waves, the waves are calling her in
Thought she would be wiser by this day
Trying to carry on with all this weight
But the world, the world is pulling her down
Just give her a smile
And tell her it's all right
These are just faces
They will pass by
And for a while let there be light
Shine on your baby
And tear up the sky
Cause every time the waves will call her in
Floating like a ship wreck with the wind
Momma used to know when she has pain
Cause the good girls, good girls always they leave
Just give her a smile
And tell her it's all right
These are just faces
They will pass by
And for a while let there be light
Shine on your baby
And tear up the sky
Cause every time the waves will call her in
Cause every time the waves will call her in
Just give her a smile
And tell her it's all right
These are just faces
They will pass by
And for a while let there be light
Shine on your baby
And tear up the sky
Cause every time the waves will call her in
