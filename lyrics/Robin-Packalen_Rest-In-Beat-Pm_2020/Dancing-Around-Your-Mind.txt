I know you think those guys are cool, yeah, I know ya
I know you love the Yeezy shoes
And the Levis jackets fit around your shoulders
Just the way that you like
I'm not a fool, yeah, I know ya
And they can drive you around downtown if they want to
In their daddies' cabriolets
And they can give you diamond rings and all the shiny things
They think that you like, oh-woah

But I'ma be real with you
I just don't dance the way they do
But somehow you think I'm cool
Yeah, somehow you think I'm cool

You still got me dancing 'round your mind
Like all the, all the time
Like all the, all the time
You still got me dancing
You still got me dancing 'round your mind
Like all the, all the time
Like all the, all the time (All the time)

I'm wearing different coloured shoes and I know it
I always end up breaking rules
I don't need no fancy things as long as you got time
For my crappy moves, oh yeah

I will be real with you (I will be real with you)
I just don't dance the way they do
But somehow you think I'm cool
Yeah, somehow you think I'm cool

You still got me dancing 'round your mind
Like all the, all the time
Like all the, all the time
You still got me dancing
You still got me dancing 'round your mind
Like all the, all the time
Like all the, all the time (All the time)

Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na
You still got me dancing 'round your, dancing 'round your mind
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na (Ooh)
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na
You still got me dancing 'round your, dancing 'round your mind
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na

Oh no, I ain't got moves like Jagger
You say it doesn't matter
Oh no, I ain't got moves like Jagger

You still got me dancing 'round your mind
Like all the, all the time
Like all the, all the time
You still got me dancing
You still got me dancing 'round your mind
Like all the, all the time
Like all the, all the time (All the time)

Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na
You still got me dancing 'round your, dancing 'round your mind
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na (Ooh)
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na (Oh, oh)
You still got me dancing 'round your, dancing 'round your mind
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na (Hey)
