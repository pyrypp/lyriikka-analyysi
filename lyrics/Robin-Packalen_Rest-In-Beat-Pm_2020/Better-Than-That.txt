Talk like an angel
Like you got me figured out
Tell me you're sorry
I know what it's all about

Now look at you-ou-ou
Busy fixing burning bridges, oh yeah (Ooh-ooh)
Don't you know, don't you know that?
I'm better than that

I was there whenever you needed me
You threw it all away just like that
Now back already begging on your knees
Really think that I'm taking you back?
Oh, you gotta be kidding me
I don't want no part in your fantasy
Now back already begging on your knees
Don't you know that I'm better than that?

(Oh-woah, oh-woah) Don't you know that I'm better than that?
(Oh-woah, oh-woah) you should know that I'm better than that
(Oh-woah, oh-woah) Don't you know that I'm better than that?
(Oh-woah, oh-woah) (You should know that I'm better than—)

Tell me you're faithful
Don't stop I wanna hear it all (I wanna hеar it all)
I keep on playing along
Like I don't know what you've done

Now look at you-ou-ou
Busy fixing burning bridgеs, oh yeah (Ooh-ooh)
Don't you know, don't you know that?
I'm better than that

I was there whenever you needed me
You threw it all away just like that
Now back already begging on your knees
Really think that I'm taking you back?
Oh, you gotta be kidding me
I don't want no part in your fantasy
Now back already begging on your knees
Don't you know that I'm better than that?

(Oh-woah, oh-woah) you should know that I'm better than that
(Oh-woah, oh-woah) don't you know that I'm better than that?

I was there whenever you needed me
You threw it all away just like that
Now back already begging on your knees
Really think that I'm taking you back?
Oh, you gotta be kidding me
