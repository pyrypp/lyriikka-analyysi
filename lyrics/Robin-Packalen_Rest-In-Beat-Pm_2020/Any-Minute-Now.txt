Telling the mirror that she is the star
Keep on repeating that if she works hard enough
She will get what she wants no matter what it takes
She's waiting tables and cleaning the bar
Changing her shoes in the bathroom to start it up
Tonight could be the night
She's addicted to the change
She's on fire she's calling
But inside her light is burning out
And she has to keep going
It's coming
Any minute now
She might be one in a million
Any minute now
Gotta tryi it or it can kill it
Any minute now
She got the taste for it
Can't live with out it anymorе
She's gonna get more
Causе she might be one in a million
Any minute now
Everyone's smiling so nice that she came
Friends all around don't remember her name
They say don't worry about it girl
You know we'll be in touch
Crawling back home but there's no time to sleep
Takes of her smile for a moment to breathe
Till it starts again
Any minute now
She might be one in a million
Any minute now
Gotta try it or it can kill it
Any minute now
She got the taste for it
Can't live with out it anymore
She's gonna get more
Cause she might be one in a million
Any minute now
She's on fire, she's calling
But inside her light is burning out
And oh she's keeps coming
She's coming
She might be one in a million
Any minute now
Gotta try it or it can kill it
She got the taste for it
Can't live with out it anymore
She's gonna get more
Cause she might be one in a million
Any minute now
